    "\n",
    "### ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)\n",
    "There was an old time when the only characters that mattered were good old unaccented English letters. ASCII is a code which was able to represent every character using a number between 32 and 127 (Codes below 32 were called unprintable and for control characters, e.g. the backspace). For example, the ASCII code of the letter A is 65. As you know, computers use a binary system and therefore the number 65 is actually encoded as a 8-bit number.\n",
    "\n",
    "A $\\rightarrow$ 0100 0001\n",
    "\n",
    "8-bit allows up to $2^{8}=256$ characters and we have only had 128 (with numbers 0-127). That means we can use the numbers 128 to 255 to represent other characters! English, of course, is not the only language that matters. Therefore, people speaking different languages chose to use the numbers 128 to 255 for the characters in their own language. This means that two different characters from two different languages may be represented by the same number in their respective encoding standard. This is no good, because when Americans would send their résumés to Israel they would arrive as rגsumגs. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### UTF-8\n",
    "Can't we have a single character set that includes every reasonable writing system on the planet? Yes we can! \n",
    "Here comes the brilliant idea of UTF-8. UTF stands for Unicode Tranformation Format. 8 means 8-bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every letter in every alphabet is assigned a number written like this: U+0041. It is called a *code point*. The U+ means \"Unicode\" and the numbers are hexadecimal. In Python, code points are written in the form \\uXXXX, where XXXX is the number in 4-digit hexadecimal form. The English letter A is assigned the number U+0041.\n",
    "\n",
    "UTF-8 was designed for backward compatibility with ASCII: the first 128 characters of Unicode, which correspond one-to-one with ASCII, are encoded using a single byte with the same binary value as ASCII.\n",
