    "Python Intermediate 2 describes the way to open, read, and write files.

For example, `pathlib` can help you accomplish tasks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find whether a particular file or directory already exists\n",
    "* Simplify the code for reading and writing to files\n",
    "* Find information about a file, including its extension\n",

    "### The `pathlib` module improves on `os`: \n",
    "\n",
    "Python also includes an older module named `os` for working with filepaths. The `os` module is not deprecated, but most Python programmers will tell you to move to the newer module. The `os` module treats paths as strings which leads to a lot of issues, especially when working with different operating systems. `pathlib` has a much nicer syntax for things like joining paths, creating directories, stemming paths, finding parents, and iterating over files. Ultimately, many of the same tasks can be done with `os`, but the code is often longer and the syntax tends to be more difficult to read and write. If you are using someone else's code that contains `os` in it, it is worth learning `os` to understand the code. For most practical purposes, however, `pathlib` is superior and it is a good idea to write new code using `pathlib` instead of `os`."
