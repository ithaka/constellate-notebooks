Of course, depending on what attributes and functions you want to include, you may represent `house1` with a different set of information stored in the **object**. In our scenario, we choose to use the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, the price of the house and a function that calculates and returns the price per square foot to represent `house1`. Let's assign this object to the variable ```house1```.\n",
