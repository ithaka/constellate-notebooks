    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions can be used to locate particular characters or sequences of characters in a string. For example, a regular expression could be written to identify phone numbers, email addresses, or particular names. Far beyond simply matching a known string, regular expressions can be written to find complex patterns in a text. They are often useful when the documents being searched are very long. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions can be used in Python, but also in many other applications such as other programming languages, word processing software (Microsoft Word, Google Docs), or email. Crafting the right regular expression can be very difficult, but can often save hours of labor for many menial tasks. When crafting a regular expression, it can be very helpful to use a tool like [RegExr](https://regexr.com/) that demonstrates how expressions are being matched on a few sample texts as you type them. The tailored expression could then be implemented in a fuller solution with Python."

For this reason, it is usually a good practice to use a raw string for passing your regular expression into `re.compile()` . A raw string starts with a `r` and skips over any escape characters, such as a new line character `\\n`."
