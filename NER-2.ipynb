    "The spaCy (spelled correctly) library is a robust machine learning library for Natural Language Processing. It supports a wide variety of languages with statistical models capable of parsing texts, identifying parts-of-speech, and extract entities. \n",

    "## Tokenization\n",
    "Recall that last time we have seen a graph showing the NLP pipeline. A pipeline's purpose is to take input data, perform some sort of operations on that input data, and then output some useful information from the data. On the pipeline, we find the pipes. A pipe is an individual component of a pipeline. Different pipes perform different tasks. After we read in the data from a text file, an essential task of NLP is tokenization. \n",

    "One form of tokenization is **word tokenization**. When we do word tokenization, we break a text up into individual words and punctuations. Another form of tokenization is **sentence tokenization**. Sentence tokenization is precisely the same as word tokenization, except instead of breaking a text up into individual words and punctuations, we break a text up into individual sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are an English speaker, you may think you do not need spaCy for sentence tokenization, because in English, the end of a sentence is indicated by a period `.`. Why not just use the the built-in `split()` function which allows us to split a text string by the period `.`? \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a ligit question, but simply splitting a text string by the period `.` will run into problems sometimes and spaCy is actually way more smarter."
