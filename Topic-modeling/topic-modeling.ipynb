    "## What is Topic Modeling?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic modeling** is a **machine learning** technique that attempts to discover groupings of words (called topics) that commonly occur together in a body of texts. The body of texts could be anything from journal articles to newspaper articles to tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic modeling** is an unsupervised, clustering technique for text. We give the machine a series of texts that it then attempts to cluster the texts into a given number of topics. There is also a *supervised*, clustering technique called **Topic Classification**, where we supply the machine with examples of pre-labeled topics and then see if the machine can identify them given the examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic modeling** is usually considered an exploratory technique; it helps us discover new patterns within a set of texts. **Topic Classification**, using labeled data, is intended to be a predictive technique; we want it to find more things like the examples we give it.\n",

The model may be trained many times with different parameters, optimizing for the lowest possible perplexity.\n",
