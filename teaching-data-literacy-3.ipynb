    "6. Click the repo flag, scroll to the bottom, and choose \"Generate token.\"\n",
    "7. Copy your personal access token and store it somewhere secure, such as a password manager. For the short term, you could store it in a text document. Once you close the tab, you will not be able to see the token anymore! If you forget or lose the token, you should delete it in GitHub and generate a new token.\n",

If you would like to always ignore the file, such as a system file like `README-checkpoint.md` then right-click on the file and choose \"Ignore this file (add to .gitignore)\". This will permanently ignore the file so long as it stays in a list of files within a .gitignore file. Files that start with a period are invisible, but you can see this file either through the command line or on the GitHub page for the repository. The only files *required* to be in the repository are Jupyter notebook files, but it is also a good practice to include a README.md file that explains the repository for anyone discovering it on GitHub.\n",
