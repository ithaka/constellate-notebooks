    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We have used several [Python](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#python) [functions](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#function) already, including `print()`, `input()`, and `range()`. You can identify a function by the fact that it ends with a set of parentheses `()` where [arguments](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#argument) can be **passed** into the function. Depending on the [function](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#function) (and your goals for using it), a [function](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#function) may accept no [arguments](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#argument), a single [argument](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#argument), or many [arguments](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#argument). For example, when we use the `print()` [function](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#function), a [string](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#string) (or a variable containing a [string](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#string)) is passed as an [argument](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#argument).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Functions](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#function) are a convenient shorthand, like a mini-program, that makes our code more **modular**. We don't need to know all the details of how the `print()` [function](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#function) works in order to use it. [Functions](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#function) are sometimes called \"black boxes\", in that we can put an [argument](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#argument) into the box and a **return value** comes out. We don't need to know the inner details of the \"black box\" to use it. (Of course, as you advance your programming skills, you may become curious about how certain [functions](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#function) work. And if you work with sensitive data, you may *need* to peer in the black box to ensure the security and accuracy of the output.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries and Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "While [Python](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#python) comes with many [functions](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#function), there are thousands more that others have written. Adding them all to [Python](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#python) would create mass confusion, since many people could use the same name for [functions](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#function) that do different things. The solution then is that [functions](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#function) are stored in [modules](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#module) that can be **imported** for use. A [module](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#module) is a [Python](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#python) file (extension \".py\") that contains the definitions for the [functions](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#function) written in [Python](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#python). These [modules](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#module) (individual [Python](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#python) files) can then be collected into even larger groups called [packages](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#package) and [libraries](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#library). Depending on how many [functions](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#function) you need for the program you are writing, you may import a single [module](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#module), a [package](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#package) of [modules](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#module), or a whole [library](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#library).\n",

    "`import module_name`\n",
    "\n",
    "You may recall from the \"Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks\" lesson, we imported the `time` [module](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#module) and used the `sleep()` [function](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#function) to wait 5 seconds."

    "We have seen that [functions](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#function) make maintaining code easier by avoiding duplication. One of the most dangerous areas for duplication is [variable](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#variable) names. As programming projects become larger, the possibility that a [variable](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#variable) will be re-used goes up. This can cause weird errors in our programs that are hard to track down. We can alleviate the problem of duplicate [variable](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#variable) names through the concepts of [local scope](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#local-scope) and [global scope](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#global-scope).\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the phrase [local scope](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#local-scope) to describe what happens within a [function](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#function). The [local scope](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#local-scope) of a [function](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#function) may contain a [local variables](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#local-variable), but once that [function](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#function) has completed the [local variables](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#local-variable) and their contents are erased.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, we can also create [global variables](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#global-variable) that persist at the top-level of the program *and also* within the [local scope](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#local-scope) of a [function](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#function).\n",

    "* In the [local scope](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#local-scope) of a [function](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#function), [Python](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#python) can recognize any [global variables](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#global-variable)\n",
    "* It is possible for there to be a [global variable](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#global-variable) and a [local variable](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#local-variable) with the same name\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, [Python](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#python) programs should limit the number of [global variables](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#global-variable) and create most [variables](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#variable) in a [local scope](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#local-scope).
