    "\n",

    "## The 5 Qualities of a Good Data Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Truthful\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a good data visualization requires us to be truthful. We should seek to be honest with ourselves and our audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Being Honest with Ourselves\n",
    "\n",
    "* Does the data cleaning and summarization create a bias toward a certain conclusion?\n",
    "* Is the conclusion leading the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Being Honest with our Audience\n",
    "\n",
    "* Does the visualization hide data?\n",
    "* Does the visualization intentionally mislead the audience?\n",
    "* Does the visualization unintentionally mislead the audience?\n",

    "### Functional\n",
    "\n",
    "A visualization is functional if it helps the audience interpret the conveyed information. There are two main questions to consider when choosing a visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What purpose does the visualization serve? \n",
    "The purpose depends on defining the audience and their desired information.\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to shape the information to help the audience achieve the purpose?\n",
    "Choosing the best shape helps the audience interpret the information easily and effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [The Functional Art](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/p/about-book.html), Alberto Cairo emphasizes that functions constrain forms. Defining the function of the visualization can help you pick the right form.\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose you are interested in the workforce data in Massachusetts. You would like to find out the data for January and February of 2023 in different counties of the state. There is a specific question that you are interested in: \n",

    "### Beautiful\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to informational charts, i.e., the kind of data visualization we focus on in this series, many experts resist using visual embellishments because excessive elements can be distracting and obscure interpretation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Edward R. Tufte, for example, calls the embellishments in charts *chartjunk*. He argues that a good visual design communicates the most possible information using the least possible ink. On the other hand, however, some research has shown that embellishments can be useful, aiding comprehension and recall ([Bateman et al. 2010](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221517808_Useful_Junk_The_effects_of_visual_embellishment_on_comprehension_and_memorability_of_charts)). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Diamond \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at an example from [Bateman et al.'s](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221517808_Useful_Junk_The_effects_of_visual_embellishment_on_comprehension_and_memorability_of_charts) paper. There are two charts in this paper that present exactly the same information: the price change of a one-carat D-flawless diamond from 1978 - 1982. If you are a reader, which chart do you think is more effective in terms of conveying this information? \n",

In *Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on human factors in computing systems* (pp. 2573-2582).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Beauty Paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "In his book [The Functional Art](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/p/about-book.html), Alberto Cairo uses the term \"the beauty paradox\" to describe the difficult choice between the minimalist design and the embellished design. If you ask which design is better, there is no absolute right answer. It depends on the audience, their knowledge, taste, expectations, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the seeming conflict between the two approaches to visual design, however, Alberto Cairo argues that a middle ground can be found between them. After all, the ultimate goals of making a visual deisgn are shared by the two approaches. That is, a visual design presents information and it helps the readers explore that information. Using these two goals as guiding principles, the creators will achieve a balance between radical minimalism and the so-called chartjunk kind of design. "

    "### Insightful\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [Chang et al.](https://viscenter.charlotte.edu/sites/viscenter.charlotte.edu/files/CVC-UNCC-08-34_0.pdf)(2009), there are several kinds of insight in visualizations. One is **spontaneous insight**. Spontaneous insight often comes directly from the graphic summary of the data. For example, in the previous section, we have seen two graphics showing the price change of a one-carat D-flawless diamond from 1978 - 1982. We immediately noticed the spike in 1980. This is the spontaneous insight we got from the graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another kind of insight is **knowledge-building insight**. When we play with an interactive visualization, it allows us to explore the information in a gradual way and in this deliberate process of exploration, we often get more knowledge. \n",
