    "## What is a word?\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a word makes intuitive sense in everyday language, but it starts to break down significantly when we begin trying to formalize it for analysis with computer programs. Linguists have spent decades creating formal rules for breaking down texts into smaller parts for analysis, dealing in great detail with the normally unspoken rules of grammar. In this lesson, we consider what a word is and consider how we could write a program for collecting the words within a text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at an example sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Now that summer's here, we're going to visit the beach at Lake Michigan and eat ice cream.\n",
    "\n",
    "How many words are in this sentence? We could start by simply looking at words that are separated by spaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Now, that, summer's, here, we're, going, to, visit, the, beach, at, Lake, Michigan, and, eat, ice, cream.\n",
    "\n",
    "That would give us 17 words. But we could ask a few questions about this count. For example, is 'Lake Michigan' one word or two words? Certainly, lake and Michigan have their own individual meanings, but Lake Michigan certainly has a different meaning from either of those words individually. Similarly, what about 'ice cream'?\n",
    "\n",
    "What about contractions? Is 'we're' a single word or two words: 'we' and 'are'? If our goal is to count how many times a given word occurs in the sentence, does 'we' occur in the sentence? Does the word 'summer' occur in our sentence?\n",
    "\n",
    "Verb conjugations pose yet another problem. Should the word 'going' be counted separately from 'go'. What about 'went'? From a computational linguistics perspective, we could 'stem' words, simply lopping off the 'ing' from 'going' to get 'go'. But that would poses some serious programming challenges for words like 'running' where the base form is 'run' instead of 'runn'. And we might run into issues with words 'sing' or 'singing' that should not have 'ing' removed in the former case but once in the later case. How could we distinguish between words that are conjugated, like'sings', and words that are plural like 'wings'. Sometimes an -s ending is plural (fens) and other times it is not (lens).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization, or segmenting a text into word chunks, is the first part of a Natural Language Processing pipeline. Tokens can be sentences, words, or sub-word chunks. The tokenization process involves many practical decisions, and this has led to many different methods that are reflected by a variety of available tokenizers. A tokenizer takes a text as input and generated tokens as output automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of tokenizing words, this is traditionally done by splitting on whitespace and punctuation. (There are more advanced tokenization methods for language models such as BERT and GPT. These include Byte-Pair Encoding, WordPiece, and SentencePiece.) We will look at a few examples of traditional tokenizers with a goal of gathering tokens into one-, two-, and three-word constructions. The general name for these is n-grams.\n",
    "\n",
    "An n-gram is a sequence of n items from a given sample of text or speech. Most often, this refers to a sequence of words, but it can also be used to analyze text at the level of syllables, letters, or phonemes. N-grams are often described by their length. For example, word n-grams might include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* stock (a 1-gram, or unigram)\n",
    "* vegetable stock (a 2-gram, or bigram)\n",
    "* homemade vegetable stock (a 3-gram, or trigram)\n",
    "\n",
    "A text analysis approach that looks only at unigrams would not be able to differentiate between the \"stock\" in \"stock market\" and \"vegetable stock.\" By including bigrams and trigrams in our analysis, we are able to look at concepts that extend across multiple words. One of the most popular examples of text analysis with n-grams is the [Google N-Gram Viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams)."

    "## Constellate Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "The Constellate [dataset builder](https://constellate.org/builder) has a historical term frequency viewer that is similar to the Google N-Gram Viewer. For example, we could create a dataset of medical journals and see how common particular terms are over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "![The Constellate Term Frequency Viewer showing diseases represented in medical journals in the 20th century](https://ithaka-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/static-files/images/tdm/tdmdocs/frequency-viewer.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "Building a dataset triggers a process that gathers up all the unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams for the documents you've selected. We are able to supply these n-gram lists with their accompanying metadata for any source, even if the materials are under copyright. This is the essence of a \"non-consumptive\" dataset. The researcher can access the n-grams but not the underlying full-text. In cases where there are no copyright restrictions, we also supply the full-text of the material.\n",
    "\n",
    "The materials are available for download and analysis in [several dataset types](https://constellate.org/docs/what-format-are-jstor-portico-datasets). The most complete type is a JSON-Lines file which contains all of the data we can legally provide. Many of the notebooks we offer rely on this [data format](https://constellate.org/docs/what-format-are-jstor-portico-datasets) and make it easy to accomplish common text analysis tasks such as counting word frequencies, creating word clouds, significant terms weighting, and topic modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can create our own Constellate-compatible datasets from any texts by extracting the unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and full text. We would then simply need to put them into the appropriate form matching the Constellate data schema. Then we could run the analyses mentioned above on our own texts. This notebook focuses on the tokenization processes to gather the unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams."
