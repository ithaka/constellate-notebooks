    "## Why learn the command line?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of our everyday experiences with computers involve using a mouse, trackpad, or touchscreen. We use familiar operations like \"clicking\", \"double-clicking\", or \"pinching\" on a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to accomplish everyday tasks like browsing the web, reading email, and playing games. Most computer users never use the command line, which foregoes using a cursor, and relies only on text input from the keyboard. Using computers in this way can seem opaque and difficult, so why do folks learn it?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few reasons:\n",
    "* Many important and useful programs have no GUI\n",
    "* The command line helps Python coders start JupyterLab and install Python packages\n",
    "* Certain file operations, like renaming hundreds of files at once, cannot be done in a GUI\n",
    "* The command line is faster for many tasks, requiring a few keystrokes rather than many clicks\n",
    "* Multi-step command line tasks can be scripted, letting users run them multiple times or at particular times\n",
    "* A simple way to connect and interact with internet servers"

By installing a unix-based command line on your Windows machine, you will learn a more popular and portable version of the command line.\n",
