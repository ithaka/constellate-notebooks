The vector length is 300 features, which means each of the 3 million words in the vocabulary is represented by a vector with 300 floating numbers. Word2Vec is one of the most popular techniques to learn word embeddings.\n",

    "The training samples are the (target, context) pairs from the text data. For example, suppose your source text is the sentence \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\". If you choose \"quick\" as your target word and have set a context window of size 2, you will get three training samples for it, i.e. (quick, the), (quick, brown) and (quick fox).   \n",

    "The network is going to learn the statistics from the number of times each (target, context) shows up. So, for example, if you have a text about kings, queens and kingdoms, the network is probably going to get many more training samples of (\"King\", \"Queen\") than (\"King\", \"kangaroo\"). Therefore, if you give your trained model the word \"King\" as input, then it will output a much higher probability for \"Queen\" than it will for \"kangaroo\"."

Specifically, you would like to use the size of a house to predict its price. You go to Redfin/Zillow and find the information about the recently sold houses in your neighborhood.

A model trained on Wikipedia, where sentences in the first person are extremely rare, will likely perform badly on Twitter. Similarly, a model trained on romantic novels will likely perform badly on legal text.\n",
