## R
First lessons coming summer 2021. For those curious, here's [an example](https://binder.tdm-pilot.org/v2/gh/mdlincoln/bindertest/tidytext?urlpath=rstudio) of RStudio running in our environment that was [created by Matt Lincoln and David Brown](https://github.com/mdlincoln/bindertest) for a 2019 Text Mining Workshop at Carnegie Mellon University.
