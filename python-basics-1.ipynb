    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) is the fastest-growing language in computer programming. Learning [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) is a great choice because [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Widely-adopted in the digital humanities and data science\n",
    "* Regarded as an easy-to-learn language\n",
    "* Flexible, having wide support for working with numerical and textual data \n",
    "* A skill desired by employers in academic, non-profit, and private sectors\n",
    "\n",
    "The second most-popular language for digital humanities and data science work is [R](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#r). We plan to create additional support for learning [R](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#r) soon. If you are interested in helping develop open educational resources for [R](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#r), please reach out to Nathan Kelber (nathan.kelber@ithaka.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "The skills you'll learn in *Python Basics* 1-5 are general-purpose [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) skills, applicable for any of the text analysis notebooks that you may explore later. They are also widely applicable to many other kinds of tasks in [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) beyond text analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Making Mistakes is Important**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every programmer at every skill level gets errors in their code. Making mistakes is how we all learn to program. Programming is a little like solving a puzzle where the goal is to get the desired outcome through a series of attempts. You won't solve the puzzle if you're afraid to test if the pieces match. An error message will not break your computer. Remember, you can always reload a notebook if it stops working properly or you misplace an important piece of code. Under the edit menu, there is an option to undo changes. (Alternatively, you can use **command z** on Mac and **control z** on Windows.) To learn any skill, you need to be willing to play and experiment. Programming is no different.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expressions and Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest form of Python programming is an [expression](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#expression) using an [operator](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#operator). An [expression](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#expression) is a simple mathematical statement like:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1 + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The [operator](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#operator) in this case is `+`, sometimes called \"plus\" or \"addition\". Try this operation in the code box below. Remember to click the \"Run\" button or press Ctrl + Enter (Windows) or shift + return (OS X) on your keyboard to run the code."

    "\n",
    "All [expressions](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#expression) evaluate to a single value. In the above examples, our [expressions](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#expression) evaluated to single numerical value. Numerical values come in two basic forms:\n",

    "\n",
    "An [integer](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#integer), what we sometimes call a \"whole number\", is a number without a decimal point that can be positive or negative. When a value uses a decimal, it is called a [float](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#float) or floating-point number. Two numbers that are mathematically equivalent could be in two different data types. For example, mathematically 5 is equal to 5.0, yet the former is an [integer](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#integer) while the latter is a [float](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#float).\n",

    "Of course, [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) can also help us manipulate text. A snippet of text in Python is called a [string](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string). A [string](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string) can be written with single or double quotes. A [string](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string) can use letters, spaces, line breaks, and numbers. So 5 is an [integer](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#integer), 5.0 is a [float](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#float), but '5' and '5.0' are [strings](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string). A [string](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string) can also be blank, such as ''.\n",

    "\n",
    "The distinction between each of these data types may seem unimportant, but [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) treats each one differently.

    "Many different kinds of programs often need to do very similar operations. Instead of writing the same code over again, you can use a [function](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function). Essentially, a [function](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function) is a small snippet of code that can be quickly referenced.
