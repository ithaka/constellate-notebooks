    "### Fork a repository\n",
    "We need to make a copy of the repository we want to base our class on. For example, you could fork any of the TAP Institute 2023 repositories:\n",

    "In order to push our changes from the Constellate lab, we need a special kind of password called a Personal Access Token. Here is how we will create it:\n",

    "1. Choose the \"Settings\" menu under your icon in the far upper-right hand corner under the user icon.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Selecting the user icon](../All-sample-files/click-on-user-icon.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "![Developer settings at the bottom](../All-sample-files/developer-settings.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Choose \"Personal Access Tokens,\" then \"Tokens (classic),\" and finally \"Generate a personal access token.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "![Generate the personal access token](../All-sample-files/generate-pat.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create a note that helps you understand what the token is for, for example \"Constellate Lab Access.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "![Example settings for the PAT](../All-sample-files/pat-settings.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Choose how long you want the token to last. You can choose for the token to never expire.\n",
    "6. Click the repo flag, scroll to the bottom, and choose \"Generate token.\"\n",
    "7. Copy your personal access token and store it somewhere secure, such as a password manager. For the short term, you could store it in a text document. Once you close the tab, you will not be able to see the token anymore! If you forget or lose the token, you should delete it in GitHub and generate a new token.\n",

    "* Tracked (This only applies to files that git has not seen before.)\n",
    "* Staged (This applies to any files you are ready to push. Usually any you have changed.)\n",

    "\n",
    "![Staging the file by clicking plus](../All-sample-files/stage-the-change.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When the file is under \"Staged,\" write a comment in the Summary field and optionally a description. The summary is required before the file can be committed, so the commit button at the bottom will be gray until a comment is written. Click \"Commit\" when your comment is finished. You may be asked to supply your Name and Email for your first commit, but it is not required after that. The name used is not significant, but the email must match the same email used for your GitHub account.\n",

If you would like to always ignore the file, such as a system file like `README-checkpoint.md` then right-click on the file and choose \"Ignore this file (add to .gitignore)\". This will permanently ignore the file so long as it stays in a list of files within a .gitignore file. Files that start with a period are invisible, but you can see this file either through the command line or on the GitHub page for the repository. The only files *required* to be in the repository are Jupyter notebook files, but it is also a good practice to include a README.md file that explains the repository for anyone discovering it on GitHub.\n",
