    "## A Full OCR Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to examining your documents and tools, you also need to carefully consider issues of time, labor, and funding. Is this project small enough for a single person to complete? How many labor-hours will it take? How many computing hours? As you complete each step, keep in mind how long certain processes take. You may need to make some hard decisions about how much to do, how accurate your text will be, or whether the project is even feasible without more funding and support. It is common for OCR project planners to greatly underestimate the necessary time, so leave generous cushion for budget and labor-hour overruns. \n",
    "\n",
    "The full OCR workflow will look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Digitize\n",
    "    * Acquire materials\n",
    "    * Photograph (at high-resolution using archival format, such as tiff/jpeg2000)\n",
    "    * Quality check (for missing pages, blurry scans, etc.)\n",
    "    * Organize \n",
    "    * Archive (into a long-term digital repository)\n",
    "2. Pre-processing (prepare image files)\n",
    "    * Convert files (to a compatible image format)\n",
    "    * Organize files (into folders by volume)\n",
    "    * Image correction (adjust skew, warp, noise, rotatation, scale, layout order, etc.)\n",
    "    * Quality check\n",
    "3. OCR batch processing\n",
    "4. Post-processing (quality assessment)\n",
    "    * Dictionary assessment\n",
    "    * Random sample assessment\n",
    "5. Archive\n",
    "    * Choosing a repository\n",
    "    * Data and metadata format\n",
    "    * Backup and hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on the OCR preprocessing and the next notebook will focus on post-processing. Beyond these two processes, the digitization and archiving steps take significant consideration, time, expertise, and effort. Ideally, these processes should be completed by experts in each domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The path outlined here is linear. In practice, however, many of these steps are more recursive and looping. As problems are discovered, the workflow will need to be adapted and improved. Again, leave cushion for budget and labor-hour overruns; you will find problems that were not obvious at the beginning of the process. For large projects with limited budgets, you will need to set goals for your accuracy and speed. Be ready to make compromises. If you're pursuing grant funding, consider separating steps 1 and 2 into two different applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A note on digitizing your own corpus:**\n",
    "If you're doing the scanning yourself or will be working with someone to digitize materials, it's a good idea to carefully plan your scanning process. Every step matters in terms of generating the best possible OCR results. [Digital NC](https://www.digitalnc.org/) have posted their digitization guidelines along with descriptions of their scanning equipment. These can provide a helpful starting point if you will be beginning your project with undigitized materials.\n",

You might have tilted your head to read some of that text—if you had been holding the paper in your hands, you might have turned the paper 90 degrees.

However, in addition to the changing typeface, there is a main column of text next to a much smaller column of [\"marginalia\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia) annotations. These annotations were created to aid readers who would have been looking for quick topical references rather than reading a volume from start to finish. These created a problem for the *On The Books* team because the computer read them as being part of the main text. What resulted (with other OCR errors removed) would have looked like:\n",

    "\n",
    "The higher quality the digitization, the better the OCR—this is the general rule. We can begin, though, with the number of pixels per image--that is, the number of pixels per *inch*. **In an ideal world, you will start with images that were scanned at 300 ppi or better.** Remember that computers present images as a grid of pixels, usually squares but sometimes rectangles, and that each carry specific color information. Put hundreds, thousands, millions of pixels together, and we have an image. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Screenshot of text stored in an image format from a page of North Carolina laws](../All-sample-files/07-ocr-01.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "A common way for computer programmers to measure image quality is by assessing the number of pixels per inch (ppi). This is important for many reasons: a photographer will want to keep their number of pixels high (perhaps 300 ppi) in preparation for printing, but a web designer will want a much lower number of pixels (72 ppi) to keep an image looking crisp while also keeping file sizes small to avoid slowing down webpage loading time. If you've ever opened a webpage and seen text but had to wait a few seconds for images to load, you've seen the difference between how long it takes for text vs. an image to load. The more pixels, the larger the file (in kilobytes, megabytes, or even gigabytes), and large files take longer to move from a server to your computer—add in low bandwidth internet, and the load time increases exponentially. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, what's the difference? Let's look:\n",
    "\n",
    "![An image of the letter S at 72 ppi and 300 ppi.](../All-sample-files/ppi-comparison.png)\n",
    "The left image shows a scanned letter S at 72 ppi. The visible squares represent individual pixels. Note that each pixel represents one color from the page, and there is a transition between pixels representing ink and those representing paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "The right image is the same letter S rescaled to 300 ppi. The squares here appear smaller because there are far more of them. Note that instead of there being only a line 1-2 pixels wide making up the S shape, there are far more for Tesseract to \"read\" and interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Per its documentation](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/ImproveQuality), Tesseract works best with an image resolution of 300 ppi. The documentation actually uses \"dpi\", or [dots per inch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch). If you're beginning your project by scanning materials, this unit will be important when you set up your scanner, but once you move into image processing, we're dealing with [pixels per inch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_density). These are not the same, but many people use dpi and ppi interchangeably."

    "\n",
    "This section introduces the most common types of image correction. The only way to discover the exact type and number of image corrections needed for your text is to try a sample of your documents. You want to create a sample that is diverse. Ideally, you would choose a large random sample of images, but it may also be worthwhile to hand-pick some examples (perhaps you know a particular volume has issues with spotting, rotation, or skewing?). Ideally, you can create a single set of image corrections that can be applied to any image and give a satisfactory result that is ready for OCR processing. In practice, you may have a custom set of operations for particular volumes that have unique problems. Depending on your images, more or less corrections may be necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "This work requires trial-and-error to figure out the best adjustments and OCR settings for your corpus. The general discovery of the best method will resemble:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a folder of sample text from your corpus.** The size of the sample may depend on the corpus' size and homogeneity or heterogeneity, but it should be an amount that you and/or your team could review manually in a reasonably short period of time.\n",
    "2. **Look for potential issues & needed adjustments.** Issues may include skewed or rotated text, fade text, smudges or damage to the page, etc.\n",
    "2. **Run OCR on your sample.**\n",
    "3. **Review the output** to identify errors, looking especially for error patterns that could be addressed at a corpus level. \n",
    "4. **Create a list of errors and possible adjustments** that you might use to address the errors. Order the list based on which errors should be solved first--which might address the largest number of errors. For example, it would be more important to fix rotated or skewed pages across the sample/corpus before trying to use erosion or dilation to make specific pages more legible to Tesseract. \n",
    "5. **Make the first adjustment** on your list to the sample.\n",
    "6. **Re-run OCR on your sample.**\n",
    "7. **Review the output.** Has the output improved noticeably? Are there still errors and error patterns? \n",

    "## Rotation\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common for image scans to have a slight rotation or skew. The result is the lines of text are sloped from left to right—either ascending or descending. \n",

    "\n",
    "*Why do errors occur when reading a rotated or skewed text?* Tesseract has been programmed to expect to \"read\" a language in the same way a human would. We read English left to right and from the top of a page down. Although we are able to parse text even when viewing it at an angle (maybe you can even read text upside down), Tesseract doesn't do this well. It will still attempt to read a rotated line from left to right--it won't know to follow the text as it slants down or up. So it returns its interpretation of the letters that fall within its line of \"sight.\" This is why, particularly with rotated texts, we may receive symbols and other unexpected characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can assess the angle of rotation using some example code from the [On the Books](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries-data/OnTheBooks/blob/master/examples/marginalia_determination/marginalia_determination.ipynb) project. The `rotation_angle()` and `find_score()` functions will help determine the level of rotation found in a given page:\n",
    "\n",
    ">The rotation_angle function accepts an original image variable as an argument. The image is then converted to a binarized numpy pixel array (bin_img). The function then defines a list of angles from -1 to 1 in intervals of .25 degrees. The loop iterates through this list, sending each angle along with bin_img to another crop function, find_score.\n",
    "\n",
    ">find_score evaluates rotations of bin_img according to each of the angles in the above list. It does so first by rotating the pixel array by the given angle. The rotated array (data) is then converted to a vertical histogram of pixel 'counts'. These values represent the number of non-zero pixels found along the horizontal axis for a given vertical axis coordinate. The function then calculates score, which is maximized for histograms with the most definitive 'peaks' and 'valleys'. A histogram with the most notable 'peaks' and 'valleys' is indicative of a text image with lines that run parallel to the horizontal axis. Thus, rotation angles that achieve higher scores have achieved more success in 'straightening' the original image.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Then after finding scores for each angle in the list, rotation_angle returns the angle with the highest score - the angle that will best straighten an image given its particular degree of skew."
