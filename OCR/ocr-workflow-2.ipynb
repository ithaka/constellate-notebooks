    "## \"Cleaning\" OCR (Post-Processing) Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**This part of the process is often best performed with a combination of manual (human) and automated (computer) steps.** This is where you may be addressing not only errors in the OCR itself but also issues with the original printing, as we describe below with regard to hyphenated words at the end of lines. As with pre-processing, how complex you make iterations in this phase depends on your corpus and your resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Review the OCR output.** Take an initial look at the OCR text files. Sometimes even just a glance will give you a sense of how well the process has gone. If you see a lot of errors, return to the pre-processing questions and consider which steps you might take to improve the OCR output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run a spellchecker & calculate the quality of the OCR output.** Use a spellchecker to get a sense of just how accurate the OCR process may have been. Note that spellchecking here, as with spellchecking in software such as Word, is really looking for known and unknown words.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Python to check for and correct possible recurring & unique spelling errors.** These are errors that appear frequently and may be caused by the typescript, hyphenation at the end of lines, or other patterns that Tesseract repeatedly misinterprets. This step should focus on common words and avoid proper nouns (unless you have a full list of proper nouns to draw from). As with any automated step, it's possible that new errors will be introduced here. If there is a known and small quantity of proper nouns used in individual texts or across the corpus, and these are consistently \"read\" incorrectly by Tesseract, it may be possible to use Python to correct these.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If your corpus is small enough and/or you have a team that can help you, **read through the corpus to manually check for and correct unique errors**. This may be a moment to correct proper nouns. If you have a team, it may be advisable to have texts read and corrected by multiple team members. It will be important that these team members have access to both inputs and outputs, and perhaps even lists of proper nouns, to be able to compare the original scans with the computer-readable versions. You may even want to set up a process whereby reviewers can flag words they are not sure about so that another reviewer can provide their opinion so that you and/or another project manager making a final decision on uncertain words.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The above process could be broken down further to address smaller issues incrementally and iteratively. It may also be useful to break your corpus into units of analysis before or during this process to assist with cleaning. Let's download a sample, OCR it, and investigate the output."

We can use Python to address both types to an extent, but it's likely that some manual review will still need to be done to ensure the highest quality OCR. Whether and how much manual review can be done will depend on the project's resources.\n",

    "*Caveat: There may be instances where variant spellings are identified as \"unknown\" (misspelled) but are true representations of the word as it was originally printed. It may be necessary to check these misspellings against the scanned pages and decide whether or not to correct the text in the OCR output.*\n",
