    "More specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    ">**OCR software attempts to replicate the combined functions of the human eye and brain, which is why it is referred to as artificial intelligence software.** A human can quickly and easily recognise text of varying fonts and of various print qualities on a newspaper page, and will apply their language and cognitive abilities to correctly translate this text into meaningful words. Humans can recognise, translate and interpret the text on a newspaper page very rapidly, even text on an old poor quality newspaper page from the 1800s. We can quickly scan layout, sections and headings, and read the text of articles in the right order (which is much more difficult than reading the page of a book). **OCR software can now do all these things too, but not to the same level of perfection as a human can.** - ([Holley, \"How Good Can It Get?

It can also be used to export editable text versions (e.g. Microsoft Word documents), or to ask the computer to read aloud the text contained in the PDF.

[Google developed it](https://opensource.google/projects/tesseract) between 2006-2018. It is still open source and maintained Zdenko Podobny. There is an [active user forum](https://groups.google.com/g/tesseract-ocr).\n",

    "Tesseract supports over [100 languages](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Data-Files-in-different-versions.html) and can be [run in the command line](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract#running-tesseract) on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Its outputs can be stored in several interoperable file formats. There are a number of [third party GUIs available](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/User-Projects-%E2%80%93-3rdParty.html).\n",

This means that if you're already working in Python, you don't need to leave your environment to build a dataset. You could also build PyTesseract into a Python application and/or into a code base that you plan to reuse.
