    "## Understanding \"Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency\" (TF-IDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF is used in machine learning and text mining for measuring the significance of particular terms for a given document. It consists of two parts that are multiplied together:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Term Frequency- A measure of how many times a given word appears in a document\n",
    "2. Inverse Document Frequency- A measure of how many times the same word occurs in other documents within the corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to merely consider word frequency, the most frequent words would be common function words like: \"the\", \"and\", \"of\". We could use a stopwords list to remove the common function words, but that still may not give us results that describe the unique terms in the document since the uniqueness of terms depends on the context of a larger body of documents. In other words, the same term could be significant or insignificant depending on the context. Consider these examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given a set of scientific journal articles in biology, the term \"lab\" may not be significant since biologists often rely on and mention labs in their research. However, if the term \"lab\" were to occur frequently in a history or English article, then it is likely to be significant since humanities articles rarely discuss labs. \n",
    "* If we were to look at thousands of articles in literary studies, then the term \"postcolonial\" may be significant for any given article. However, if were to look at a few hundred articles on the topic of \"the global south,\" then the term \"postcolonial\" may occur so frequently that it is not a significant way to differentiate between the articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TF-IDF calculation reveals the words that are frequent in this document **yet rare in other documents**. The goal is to find out what is unique or remarkable about a document given the context and that context can change the results of the analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how the calculation is mathematically written:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$tfidf_{t,d} = tf_{t,d} \\cdot idf_{t,D}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In plain English, this means: **The value of TF-IDF is the product (or multiplication) of a given term's frequency multiplied by its inverse document frequency.** Let's unpack these terms one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Term Frequency Function\n",
    "\n",
    "$$tf_{t,d}$$\n",
    "The number of times (t) a term occurs in a given document (d)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inverse Document Frequency Function\n",
    "\n",
    "$$idf_i = \\mbox{log} \\frac{N}{|{d : t_i \\in d}|}$$\n",
    "The inverse document frequency can be expanded to the calculation on the right. In plain English, this means: **The log of the total number of documents (N) divided by the number of documents that contain the term**\n",
    "\n",
    "### TF-IDF Calculation in Plain English\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ tf-idf = (Number-of-times-the-word-occurs-in-given-document) \\cdot \\mbox{log} \\frac{(Total-number-of-documents)}{(Total-number-of-documents-containing-the-word)}$$\n",
