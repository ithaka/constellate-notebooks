    "\n",
    "In his book [The Truthful Art](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/p/the-truthful-art-book.html), Alberto Cairo proposes a five-part framework to evaluate the qualities of a data visualization. He says that a good data visualization should be :\n",

    "* Enlightening\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Truthful\n",
    "\n",
    "A good data visualization is truthful. This requires us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* be honest with ourselves; \n",
    "* be honest with our audience \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we should be honest with ourselves. Ask whether the way we clean and summarize the data biases toward a certain conclusion. We should not have a pre-determined conclusion in mind and then look for data to support it. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we should be honest with our audience. We use data visualizations to convey our best understanding of the reality. If a data visualization hides data from the audience or misleads the audience, it is not a good data visualization no matter how clear and attrative it is. \n",

    "\n",
    "When it comes to information charts, i.e., the kind of data visualization we focus on in this series, many experts resist using visual embellishments because they think such excessive elements are distracting and often cause interpretation problems. Edward R. Tufte, for example, calls the embelliments in charts *chartjunk*. He argues that a good visual design communites the most possible information using the least possible ink. On the other hand, however, research shows that embellishments can be useful because they sometimes help comprehension and lead to long-term recall ([Bateman et al. 2010](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221517808_Useful_Junk_The_effects_of_visual_embellishment_on_comprehension_and_memorability_of_charts)). \n",

    "\n",
    "In his book [The Functional Art](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/p/about-book.html), Alberto Cairo uses the term \"the beauty paradox\" to describe the difficult choice between the minimalist design and the embellished design. If you ask which design is better, there is no absolute right answer. It depends on the audience, their knowledge, taste, expectations, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the seeming conflict between the two approaches to visual design, however, Alberto Cairo argues that a middle ground can be found between them. After all, the ultimate goals of making a visual deisgn are shared by the two approaches. That is, a visual design presents information and it helps the readers explore that information. Using these two goals as guiding principles, the creators will achieve a balance between radical minimalism and the so-called chartjunk kind of design. "

    "\n",
    "According to [Chang et al.](https://viscenter.charlotte.edu/sites/viscenter.charlotte.edu/files/CVC-UNCC-08-34_0.pdf)(2009), there are several kinds of insight in visualizations. One is **spontaneous insight**. Spontaneous insight often comes directly from the graphic summary of the data. For example, in the previous section, we have seen two graphics showing the price change of a one-carat D-flawless diamond from 1978 - 1982. We immediately noticed the spike in 1980. This is the spontaneous insight we got from the graphics.\n",
