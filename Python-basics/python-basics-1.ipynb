    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is the fastest-growing language in computer programming. Learning Python is a great choice because Python is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Widely-adopted in the digital humanities and data science\n",
    "* Regarded as an easy-to-learn language\n",
    "* Flexible, having wide support for working with numerical and textual data \n",
    "* A skill desired by employers in academic, non-profit, and private sectors\n",
    "\n",
    "The second most-popular language for digital humanities and data science work is R. We plan to create additional support for learning R soon. If you are interested in helping develop open educational resources for R, please reach out to Nathan Kelber (nathan.kelber@ithaka.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "The skills you'll learn in *Python Basics* 1-5 are general-purpose Python skills, applicable for any of the text analysis notebooks that you may explore later. They are also widely applicable to many other kinds of tasks in Python beyond text analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Making Mistakes is Important**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every programmer at every skill level gets errors in their code. Making mistakes is how we all learn to program. Programming is a little like solving a puzzle where the goal is to get the desired outcome through a series of attempts. You won't solve the puzzle if you're afraid to test if the pieces match. An error message will not break your computer. Remember, you can always reload a notebook if it stops working properly or you misplace an important piece of code. Under the edit menu, there is an option to undo changes. (Alternatively, you can use **command z** on Mac and **control z** on Windows.) To learn any skill, you need to be willing to play and experiment. Programming is no different.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expressions and Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest form of Python programming is an expression using an operator. An expression is a simple mathematical statement like:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1 + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The operator in this case is `+`, sometimes called \"plus\" or \"addition\". Try this operation in the code box below. Remember to click the \"Run\" button or press Ctrl + Enter (Windows) or shift + return (OS X) on your keyboard to run the code."

    "## Data Types (Integers, Floats, and Strings)\n",
    "\n",
    "All expressions evaluate to a single value. In the above examples, our expressions evaluated to single numerical value. Numerical values come in two basic forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* integer\n",
    "* float (or floating-point number)\n",

For example, mathematically 5 is equal to 5.0, yet the former is an integer while the latter is a float.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, Python can also help us manipulate text. A snippet of text in Python is called a string. A string can be written with single or double quotes. A string can use letters, spaces, line breaks, and numbers. So 5 is an integer, 5.0 is a float, but '5' and '5.0' are strings. A string can also be blank, such as ''.\n",
    "\n",

    "|Text|string| 'Hello world', '1700 butterflies', '', '1823'|\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction between each of these data types may seem unimportant, but Python treats each one differently. For example, we can ask Python whether an integer is equal to a float, but we cannot ask whether a string is equal to an integer or a float.\n",
    "\n",
