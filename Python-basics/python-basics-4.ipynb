    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We have used several Python functions already, including `print()`, `input()`, and `range()`. You can identify a function by the fact that it ends with a set of parentheses `()` where arguments can be **passed** into the function. Depending on the function (and your goals for using it), a function may accept no arguments, a single argument, or many arguments. For example, when we use the `print()` function, a string (or a variable containing a string) is passed as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are a convenient shorthand, like a mini-program, that makes our code more **modular**. We don't need to know all the details of how the `print()` function works in order to use it. Functions are sometimes called \"black boxes\", in that we can put an argument into the box and a **return value** comes out. We don't need to know the inner details of the \"black box\" to use it. (Of course, as you advance your programming skills, you may become curious about how certain functions work. And if you work with sensitive data, you may *need* to peer in the black box to ensure the security and accuracy of the output.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries and Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "While Python comes with many functions, there are thousands more that others have written. Adding them all to Python would create mass confusion, since many people could use the same name for functions that do different things. The solution then is that functions are stored in modules that can be **imported** for use. A module is a Python file (extension \".py\") that contains the definitions for the functions written in Python. These modules (individual Python files) can then be collected into even larger groups called packages and libraries. Depending on how many functions you need for the program you are writing, you may import a single module, a package of modules, or a whole library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general form of importing a module is:\n",
    "`import module_name`\n",
    "\n",
    "You may recall from the \"Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks\" lesson, we imported the `time` module and used the `sleep()` function to wait 5 seconds."

As programming projects become larger, the possibility that a variable will be re-used goes up. This can cause weird errors in our programs that are hard to track down. We can alleviate the problem of duplicate variable names through the concepts of local scope and global scope.\n",
