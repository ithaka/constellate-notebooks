Harry  ,"B-but, that day, during the Quidditch Match, Snape tried to kill me.",film 1,
Quirrell  ,"No, dear boy. I tried to kill you! ",film 1,

Dumbledore,He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. ,film 1,
Dumbledore,"But yes, he will die.",film 1,
Harry  ,"How is it I got the Stone, sir? ",film 1,
Harry  ,"One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next...",film 1,
Dumbledore,"Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. ",film 1,
Dumbledore,That is one of my more brilliant ideas. ,film 1,
Dumbledore,And between you and me thats saying something.,film 1,
Harry  ,"Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?",film 1,
Dumbledore ,"Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. ",film 1,
Dumbledore ,"Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him?",film 1,
Dumbledore ,It was because of your mother. ,film 1,
Dumbledore ,"She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. ",film 1,
Dumbledore ,"No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen.",film 1,
Dumbledore ,It lives in your very skin.,film 1,
Harry ,What is it?,film 1,
Dumbledore,"Love, Harry, love. ",film 1,
Dumbledore,Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. ,film 1,

MCGONAGALL,He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families.,film 2,
MCGONAGALL,"In other words, pure-bloods.",film 2,
MCGONAGALL,"Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school.",film 2,
MCGONAGALL,"Now, according to legend Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle known as the Chamber of Secrets.",film 2,
MCGONAGALL,"Though, shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own true Heir returned to the school.",film 2,
MCGONAGALL,"The Heir alone would be able to open the Chamber and unleash the horror within, and by so doing purge the school of all those who in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic.",film 2,
HERMIONE,Muggle-borns.,film 2,
MCGONAGALL,"Well , Naturally, the school has been searched many times.",film 2,
MCGONAGALL,No such chamber has been found.,film 2,
HERMIONE,Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?,film 2,
MCGONAGALL,The Chamber is said to be home to something that only the Heir of Slytherin can control.,film 2,
MCGONAGALL,It is said to be the home of a monster.,film 2,
RON,Do you think it's true?,film 2,
RON, Do you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?,film 2,
HERMIONE,Yes. Couldn't you tell? ,film 2,
HERMIONE,McGonagall's worried. ,film 2,
HERMIONE,All the teachers are.,film 2,
HARRY,"If there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it has been opened, that means... ",film 2,
HERMIONE,The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. ,film 2,
HERMIONE,"The question is, who is it?",film 2,

HARRY,"I mean, look at his family.",film 2,
HARRY,The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.,film 2,
RON,Crabbe and Goyle must know.,film 2,
RON,Maybe we could trick them into telling.,film 2,
HERMIONE,Even they aren't that thick.,film 2,
HERMIONE,But there might be another way.,film 2,
HERMIONE,"Mind you, it would be difficult.",film 2,
HERMIONE,Not to mention we'd be breaking about 50 school rules...,film 2,
HERMIONE,and it'll be dangerous.,film 2,
HERMIONE,Very dangerous.,film 2,
HERMIONE,Here it is.,film 2,
HERMIONE,The Polyjuice Potion.,film 2,
HERMIONE,"Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another.",film 2,
RON,"You mean if Harry and I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?",film 2,
HERMIONE,Yes ,film 2,
RON,Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.,film 2,
HERMIONE,Exactly.,film 2,
HERMIONE,But it's tricky. ,film 2,
HERMIONE,I've never seen a more complicated potion.,film 2,
HARRY,How long will it take to make?,film 2,
HERMIONE,A month.,film 2,
HARRY,A month?,film 2,
HARRY,"But, Hermione,",film 2,
HARRY,if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then.,film 2,
HERMIONE,I know.,film 2,
HERMIONE,But it's the only plan we've got.,film 2,

GILDEROY LOCKHART,"Yes, well, that can sometimes happen but the point is you can no longer feel any pain, and, very clearly, the bones are not broken.",film 2,
HAGRID,Broken? There's no bones left.,film 2,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"Much more flexible, though.",film 2,
MADAM POMFREY,"Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss.",film 2,
MADAM POMFREY,You can go. Out of my way.,film 2,
MADAM POMFREY,Should have been brought straight to me.,film 2,

DOBBY,"Indeed. Yes, sir.",film 2,
HARRY,You nearly got Ron and me expelled.,film 2,

DOBBY,Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see...,film 2,

RON,Now he's taught Draco how to do it.,film 2,
HERMIONE,Maybe.,film 2,
HERMIONE,We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.,film 2,

LUCIUS MALFOY,No.,film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,I simply called up the school and was told the headmaster was here.,film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,"Well, what exactly is it that you want with me?",film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,The other governors and I have decided it's time for you to step aside.,film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,This is an order of suspension.,film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,You'll find all 12 signatures on it.,film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,I'm afraid we feel you've rather lost your touch.,film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,"Well, what, with all these attacks there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts.",film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,I can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school.,film 2,
HAGRID,You can't take Professor Dumbledore away.,film 2,
HAGRID,Take him away and the Muggle-borns won't stand a chance.,film 2,
HAGRID,"You mark my words, there'll be killings next!",film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,You think so?,film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,"Calm yourself, Hagrid.",film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,"If the governors desire my removal I will, of course, step aside.",film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,However you will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.,film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,Admirable sentiments.,film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,Shall we?,film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,Fudge.,film 2,
FUDGE,"Come, Hagrid.",film 2,
HAGRID,Well? If...,film 2,
HAGRID,If anybody was looking for some stuff then all they'd have to do would be to follow the spiders.,film 2,
HAGRID,Yep. That would lead them right.,film 2,
HAGRID,That's all I have to say.,film 2,
HAGRID,And someone will need to feed Fang while I'm away.,film 2,
FUDGE,Good boy.,film 2,
RON,Hagrid's right.,film 2,
RON,"With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day.",film 2,

HARRY,You heard what Hagrid said.,film 2,
HARRY,Follow the spiders.,film 2,

HARRY,"You're Aragog, aren't you?",film 2,
ARAGOG,Yes.,film 2,
ARAGOG,Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.,film 2,
HARRY,"He's in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks.",film 2,
HARRY,They think it's Hagrid.,film 2,
HARRY,They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.,film 2,
ARAGOG,That's a lie.,film 2,
ARAGOG,Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.,film 2,
HARRY,Then you're not the monster?,film 2,
ARAGOG,No.,film 2,
ARAGOG,The monster was born in the castle.,film 2,
ARAGOG,I came to Hagrid from a distant land in the pocket of a traveler.,film 2,
RON,Harry.,film 2,
HARRY,"But if you're not the monster, then what did kill that girl 50 years ago?",film 2,
ARAGOG,We do not speak of it.,film 2,
ARAGOG,It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others.,film 2,
HARRY,But have you seen it?,film 2,
ARAGOG,I never saw any part of the castle but the box in which Hagrid kept me.,film 2,
ARAGOG,The girl was discovered in a bathroom.,film 2,
ARAGOG,"When I was accused, Hagrid brought me here.",film 2,

HARRY,What?,film 2,
HARRY,"Well, thank you.",film 2,
HARRY,We'll just go.,film 2,
ARAGOG,Go?,film 2,
ARAGOG,I think not.,film 2,
ARAGOG,My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command.,film 2,
ARAGOG,But I cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst.,film 2,
ARAGOG,"Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.",film 2,
RON,Can we panic now?,film 2,
RON,Know any spells?,film 2,
HARRY,"One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them.",film 2,
RON,Where's Hermione when you need her?,film 2,
HARRY,Let's go!,film 2,
HARRY,Arania Exumai!,film 2,Arania Exumai
HARRY,Go!,film 2,

HARRY,He was innocent.,film 2,
HARRY,"Wish you were here, Hermione.",film 2,
HARRY,We need you.,film 2,
HARRY,Now more than ever.,film 2,
RON,What's that?,film 2,
HARRY,Ron...,film 2,
HARRY,This is why Hermione was in the library the day she was attacked.,film 2,
HARRY,Come on.,film 2,
HARRY,Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land none is more deadly than the basilisk.,film 2,
HARRY,Capable of living for hundreds of years instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye.,film 2,
HARRY,Spiders flee before it.,film 2,
HARRY,"Ron, this is it.",film 2,
HARRY,The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk.,film 2,
HARRY,That's why I can hear it speak.,film 2,
HARRY,It's a snake.,film 2,
RON,"But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead?",film 2,
HARRY,Because no one did look it in the eye.,film 2,
HARRY,"Not directly, at least.",film 2,
HARRY,Colin saw it through his camera.,film 2,
HARRY,Justin... Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.,film 2,
HARRY,Nick got the full blast of it.,film 2,
HARRY,"But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again.",film 2,
HARRY,And Hermione had the mirror.,film 2,
HARRY,I bet you she was using it to look around corners in case it came along.,film 2,
RON,And Mrs. Norris?,film 2,
RON,"I'm pretty sure she didn't havea camera or a mirror, Harry.",film 2,
HARRY,The water.,film 2,
HARRY,There was water on the floor that night.,film 2,
HARRY,She only saw the basilisk's reflection.,film 2,
HARRY,Spiders flee before it.,film 2,
HARRY,It all fits.,film 2,
RON,How's a basilisk been getting around?,film 2,
RON,"A dirty, great snake.",film 2,
RON,Someone would have seen it.,film 2,
HARRY,Hermione's answered that too.,film 2,
RON,Pipes? It's using the plumbing.,film 2,
HARRY,Remember what Aragog said about that girl 50 years ago?,film 2,
HARRY,She died in a bathroom?,film 2,
HARRY,What if she never left?,film 2,
RON,Moaning Myrtle.,film 2,
MCGONAGALL,All students are to return to their house dormitories at once.,film 2,
MCGONAGALL,All teachers to the second-floor corridor immediately.,film 2,
MCGONAGALL,"As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message.",film 2,
MCGONAGALL,Our worst fear has been realized.,film 2,
MCGONAGALL,A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself.,film 2,
MCGONAGALL,The students must be sent home.,film 2,
MCGONAGALL,I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.,film 2,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,So sorry. Dozed off.,film 2,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,What have I missed?,film 2,
SNAPE,"A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. ",film 2,
SNAPE,Your moment has come at last.,film 2,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,My moment?,film 2,
SNAPE,Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?,film 2,
MCGONAGALL,That's settled. ,film 2,
MCGONAGALL,"We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy.",film 2,
MCGONAGALL,"Your skills, after all, are legend.",film 2,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Very well.,film 2,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,I'll just be in my office getting...,film 2,

RON,Ginny.,film 2,
HARRY,"Lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber.",film 2,
HARRY,At least we can tell him what we know.,film 2,
HARRY,"Professor, we have some information for you.",film 2,
HARRY,Are you going somewhere?,film 2,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"Well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable.",film 2,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Got to go.,film 2,
RON,What about my sister?,film 2,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Well… Aemm…,film 2,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"As to that, most unfortunate.",film 2,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,No one regrets more than I.,film 2,
RON,You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. ,film 2,
RON,You can't go now.,film 2,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"I must say, when I took the job, there was nothing in the description...",film 2,
HARRY,You're running away?,film 2,
HARRY,After all you did in your books?,film 2,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Books can be misleading.,film 2,
HARRY,You wrote them.,film 2,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"My dear boy, use your common sense.",film 2,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,My books wouldn't have sold as well if people didn't think I'd done those things.,film 2,
HARRY,You're a fraud.,film 2,
HARRY,You've been taking credit for what other wizards have done.,film 2,
RON,Is there anything you can do?,film 2,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"Yes, now you mention it.",film 2,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms.,film 2,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"Otherwise, all those wizards would have gone blabbing.",film 2,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,I'd never have sold another book.,film 2,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"In fact, I'm going to have to do the same to you.",film 2,
HARRY,Don't even think about it.,film 2,
MOANING MYRTLE,Who's there?,film 2,
MOANING MYRTLE,"Hello, Harry.",film 2,
MOANING MYRTLE,What do you want?,film 2,
HARRY,To ask you how you died.,film 2,
MOANING MYRTLE,It was dreadful.,film 2,
MOANING MYRTLE,It happened right here in this very cubicle.,film 2,
MOANING MYRTLE,I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses.,film 2,
MOANING MYRTLE,"I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in.",film 2,
HARRY,"Who was it, Myrtle?",film 2,
MOANING MYRTLE,I don't know. I was distraught!,film 2,
MOANING MYRTLE,"But they said something funny, a kind of made-up language.",film 2,
MOANING MYRTLE,"And I realized it was a boy, so I unlocked the door to tell him to go away and I died.",film 2,
HARRY,Just like that? How?,film 2,
MOANING MYRTLE,"I just remember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes over there by that sink.",film 2,

GILDEROY LOCKHART,"Now, boys, what good will it do?",film 2,
RON,Better you than us.,film 2,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,"But... Obviously, yes.",film 2,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Sure you don't want to test it first?,film 2,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,It's really quite filthy down here.,film 2,
HARRY,All right. Let's go.,film 2,
MOANING MYRTLE,"Oh, Harry?",film 2,
MOANING MYRTLE,"If you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet.",film 2,

RON,Go on.,film 2,
HARRY,This way.,film 2,
RON,What's this?,film 2,

HARRY,It's a snake skin.,film 2,
RON,Bloody hell.,film 2,
RON,Whatever shed this must be 60 feet long. Or more.,film 2,
RON,"Heart of a lion, this one.",film 2,

GILDEROY LOCKHART,"It's an odd sort of place, isn't it?",film 2,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Do you live here?,film 2,

GILDEROY LOCKHART,Really?,film 2,
RON,What do I do now?,film 2,

HARRY,"Give me my wand, Tom.",film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,You won't be needing it.,film 2,
HARRY,We've got to go. We've got to save her.,film 2,

TOM RIDDLE,"Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets.",film 2,
HARRY,No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.,film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls.,film 2,
HARRY,But why?,film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,Because I told her to.,film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,You'll find I can be very persuasive.,film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,Not that she knew what she was doing.,film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,"She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance.",film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,"Still, the power of the diary began to scare her.",film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,She tried to dispose of it in the girls' bathroom.,film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,And then who should find it but you?,film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,The very person I was most anxious to meet.,film 2,
HARRY,And why did you want to meet me?,film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,"I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could.",film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf Hagrid to gain your trust.,film 2,
HARRY,Hagrid's my friend.,film 2,
HARRY,"And you framed him, didn't you?",film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,It was my word against Hagrid's.,film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.,film 2,
HARRY,I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.,film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that.,film 2,
TOM RIDDLE, I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was at school so I decided to leave behind a diary preserving my 16-year-old self in its pages so that one day,film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work.,film 2,
HARRY,"Well, you haven't finished it this time.",film 2,
HARRY,"In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready.",film 2,
HARRY,And everyone who was Petrified will be all right again.,film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore.,film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,"For many months now, my new target has been you.",film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,How is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time?,film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,How did you escape with nothing but a scar while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?,film 2,
HARRY,Why do you care how I escaped?,film 2,
HARRY,Voldemort was after your time.,film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,"Voldemort is my past, present and future.",film 2,
HARRY,You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.,film 2,
HARRY,You're Voldemort.,film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,Surely you didn't think .I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name?,film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,"No. I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would fear to speak when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world.",film 2,
HARRY,Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world.,film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me.,film 2,
HARRY,He'll never be gone. ,film 2,
HARRY,Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him.,film 2,
HARRY,Fawkes?,film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,So this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender.,film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,A songbird and an old hat.,film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,"Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin against the famous Harry Potter.",film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,"Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter. ",film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,It only obeys me.,film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,"No! Your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still hear you.",film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,"Yes, Potter.",film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,The process is nearly complete.,film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,"In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be dead, and I will cease to be a memory.",film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,Lord Voldemort will return .very much alive.,film 2,
HARRY,Ginny?,film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,"Remarkable, isn't it? how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body?",film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,I'd guess you have little more than a minute to live.,film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,"You'll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry.",film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,"Funny, the damage a silly little book can do especially in the hands of a silly little girl.",film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,What are you doing?,film 2,
TOM RIDDLE,Stop. No!,film 2,
HARRY,Ginny?,film 2,
GINNY,"Harry, It was me.",film 2,
GINNY,"But I swear, I didn't mean to.",film 2,
GINNY,"Riddle made me, and...",film 2,
GINNY,"Harry, you're hurt.",film 2,
HARRY,Don't worry.,film 2,
HARRY,"Ginny, you need to get yourself out.",film 2,
HARRY,Follow the Chamber and you'll find Ron.,film 2,
HARRY,"You were brilliant, Fawkes.",film 2,
HARRY,I just wasn't quick enough.,film 2,
HARRY,Of course.,film 2,
HARRY,Phoenix tears have healing powers.,film 2,
HARRY,Thanks.,film 2,
HARRY,"It's all right, Ginny.",film 2,
HARRY,It's over.,film 2,
HARRY,It's just a memory.,film 2,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,Amazing!,film 2,
GILDEROY LOCKHART,This is just like magic!,film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,"You both realize, of course that in the past few hours, you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules.",film 2,
HARRY AND RON,"Yes, sir.",film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,There is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.,film 2,
HARRY AND RON,"Yes, sir.",film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,"Therefore, it is only fitting that you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School.",film 2,
RON,"Thanks, sir.",film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,"Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban.",film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,I believe we want our gamekeeper back.,film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,"Harry, First, I want to thank you, Harry.",film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber.,film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.,film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,And second I sense that something is troubling you.,film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,"Am I right, Harry?",film 2,
HARRY,It's just...,film 2,
HARRY,"You see, sir, I couldn't help but notice certain things, certain...",film 2,
HARRY,Certain similarities between Tom Riddle and me.,film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,I see.,film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,"Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why?",film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue.,film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,"If I'm not mistaken, Harry he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar.",film 2,
HARRY,Voldemort transferred some of his powers to me?,film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,Not intentionally but yes.,film 2,
HARRY,So the Sorting Hat was right.,film 2,
HARRY,I should be in Slytherin.,film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,It's true. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.,film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,"Determination, resourcefulness and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules.",film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,"Why, then, did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?",film 2,
HARRY,Because I asked it to.,film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,"Exactly, Harry. Exactly.",film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,Which makes you different from Voldemort.,film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,It is not our abilities that show what we truly are.,film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,It is our choices.,film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor then I suggest you look more closely at this.,film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,Be careful.,film 2,
HARRY,Godric Gryffindor.,film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,It would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat.,film 2,
HARRY,Dobby.,film 2,
HARRY,So this is your master.,film 2,
HARRY,The family you serve is the Malfoys.,film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,I'll deal with you later.,film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,"Out of my way, Potter.",film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,So it's true. You have returned.,film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,"When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley's daughter was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back.",film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,Ridiculous.,film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,"Curiously, Lucius, several of them were under the impression that you would curse their family if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place.",film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,How dare you!,film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,Beg your pardon?,film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,"My sole concern has always been and will always be the welfare of this school and, of course, its students.",film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,"The culprit has been identified, I presume?",film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,Yes.,film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,And?,film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,Who was it?,film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,Voldemort.,film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,Only this time he chose to act through somebody else by means of this.,film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,I see.,film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,"Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it.",film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school-things should find their way into innocent hands.,film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,The consequences for the one responsible would be severe.,film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,"Well, let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day.",film 2,
HARRY,Don't worry. I will be.,film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,Dumbledore.,film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,"Come, Dobby. We're leaving.",film 2,
HARRY,Sir? I wonder if I could have that?,film 2,
HARRY,Mr. Malfoy.,film 2,
HARRY,Mr. Malfoy!,film 2,
HARRY,I have something of yours.,film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,Mine? I don't know what you're talking about.,film 2,
HARRY,"I think you do, sir.",film 2,
HARRY,I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron that day at Diagon Alley.,film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,"You do, do you?",film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,Why don't you prove it?,film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,"Come, Dobby.",film 2,
HARRY,Open it.,film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,Dobby.,film 2,
DOBBY,Master has given Dobby a sock.,film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,What? I didn't give...,film 2,
DOBBY,Master has presented Dobby with clothes.,film 2,
DOBBY,Dobby is free.,film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,You lost me my servant!,film 2,
DOBBY,You shall not harm Harry Potter.,film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,Your parents were meddlesome fools too.,film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,"Mark my words, Potter.",film 2,
LUCIUS MALFOY,One day soon you are going to meet the same sticky end.,film 2,
DOBBY,Harry Potter freed Dobby.,film 2,
DOBBY,How can Dobby ever repay him?,film 2,
HARRY,Just promise me something.,film 2,
DOBBY,"Anything, sir.",film 2,
HARRY,Never try to save my life again.,film 2,

HARRY,We had loads of help from you.,film 2,
HARRY,We couldn't have done it without you.,film 2,
HERMIONE,Thanks.,film 2,
MCGONAGALL,"Could I have your attention, please?",film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,"Before we begin the feast let us have a round of applause for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey whose Mandrake juice has been so successfully administered to all who had been Petrified.",film 2,
DUMBLEDORE,"Also, in light of the recent events as a school treat all exams have been canceled.",film 2,
HERMIONE,"Oh, no.",film 2,
HAGRID,Sorry I'm late.,film 2,
HAGRID,The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused.,film 2,
HAGRID,Some ruddy bird called Errol.,film 2,
HAGRID,"And I'd just like to say that if it hadn't been for you, Harry and Ron and Hermione, of course I would still be you-know-where so I'd just like to say thanks.",film 2,
HARRY,"There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid.",film 2,

HERMIONE,"But they'll catch Black, won't they?",film 3,
HERMIONE,"I mean, everyone's looking for him.",film 3,
RON,Sure.,film 3,
RON,"Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.",film 3,
HARRY,"Thanks, Ron.",film 3,
HERMIONE,Why are we stopping?,film 3,
HERMIONE,We can't be there yet.,film 3,
RON,What's going on?,film 3,

LUPIN,"If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver.",film 3,
LUPIN,Eat. You'll feel better.,film 3,
HARRY,What happened to me?,film 3,

HARRY,And did either of you two you know pass out?,film 3,
RON,No.,film 3,
RON,"I felt weird, though.",film 3,
RON,Like I'd never be cheerful again.,film 3,
HARRY,But someone was screaming.,film 3,
HARRY,A woman.,film 3,

DUMBLEDORE,The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.,film 3,
DUMBLEDORE,Now whilst I've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities a word of caution.,film 3,
DUMBLEDORE,Dementors are vicious creatures.,film 3,
DUMBLEDORE,They'll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.,film 3,
DUMBLEDORE,"Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you.",film 3,
DUMBLEDORE,It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.,film 3,

BEM,"It's an omen of death.""",film 3,
RON,You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?,film 3,
HERMIONE,"Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline.",film 3,
HERMIONE,"Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.",film 3,
RON,Ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking?,film 3,
HERMIONE,A fair few.,film 3,
RON,Hang on. That's not possible.,film 3,
RON,Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.,film 3,

LUPIN,Very good.,film 3,
LUPIN,So much for the easy part. ,film 3,
LUPIN,"You see, the incantation alone is not enough.",film 3,
LUPIN,What really finishes a boggart is laughter.,film 3,
LUPIN,You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing. ,film 3,
LUPIN,"Let me explain. Neville, would you join me, please?",film 3,
LUPIN,"Come on, don't be shy. Come on.",film 3,
LUPIN,Come on.,film 3,

FILCH,"Those with permission, follow me.",film 3,
FILCH,"Those without, stay put.",film 3,
HARRY,"I thought if you signed it, then I could...",film 3,
MCGONAGALL,I can't. Only a parent or a guardian can sign.,film 3,
MCGONAGALL,"Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate.",film 3,
MCGONAGALL,"I'm sorry, Potter.",film 3,
MCGONAGALL,That's my final word.,film 3,
HARRY,"Forget about it, guys. See you later.",film 3,
HARRY,"Professor, can I ask you something?",film 3,
LUPIN,"You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?",film 3,
LUPIN,I thought it'd be obvious.,film 3,
LUPIN,I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.,film 3,
HARRY,I did think of Voldemort at first.,film 3,
HARRY,But then I remembered that night on the train and the dementor.,film 3,
LUPIN,I'm very impressed.,film 3,
LUPIN,That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.,film 3,
LUPIN,This is very wise.,film 3,
HARRY,Before I fainted I heard something.,film 3,
HARRY,A woman screaming.,film 3,
LUPIN,Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.,film 3,
LUPIN,Our pain becomes their power.,film 3,
HARRY,I think it was my mother the night she was murdered.,film 3,
LUPIN,"The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately.",film 3,
LUPIN,"Not by your scar, by your eyes.",film 3,
LUPIN,"They're your mother, Lily's.",film 3,
LUPIN,"Yes. Oh, yes. I knew her.",film 3,
LUPIN,Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.,film 3,
LUPIN,Not only was she a singularly gifted witch she was also an uncommonly kind woman.,film 3,
LUPIN,"She had a way of seeing the beauty in others even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves.",film 3,
LUPIN,"And your father, James, on the other hand he...",film 3,
LUPIN,"He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble.",film 3,
LUPIN,"A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you.",film 3,
LUPIN,"You're more like them than you know, Harry.",film 3,
LUPIN,"In time, you'll come to see just how much.",film 3,

DUMBLEDORE,Thank you.,film 3,
TEACHER,"The third floor's clear too, sir.",film 3,
DUMBLEDORE,Very good.,film 3,
SNAPE,I've done the dungeons.,film 3,
SNAPE,"No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.",film 3,
DUMBLEDORE,I didn't really expect him to linger.,film 3,
SNAPE,"Remarkable feat, don't you think?",film 3,
SNAPE,To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own completely undetected?,film 3,
DUMBLEDORE,"Quite remarkable, yes.",film 3,
SNAPE,Any theories on how he managed it?,film 3,
DUMBLEDORE,Many. Each as unlikely as the next.,film 3,
SNAPE,You may recall prior to the start of term I expressed concerns about your appointment of Professor...,film 3,
DUMBLEDORE,Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.,film 3,
DUMBLEDORE,I'm quite convinced the castle is safe and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.,film 3,
SNAPE,What about Potter?,film 3,
SNAPE,Should he be warned?,film 3,
DUMBLEDORE,"Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.",film 3,
DUMBLEDORE,"For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.",film 3,

HARRY,"Excuse me, sir.",film 3,
HARRY,Where's Professor Lupin?,film 3,

RON,Did you see her come in?,film 3,
SNAPE,"Now, which one of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?",film 3,
SNAPE,No one?,film 3,
SNAPE,How disappointing.,film 3,
HERMIONE,"Please, sir.",film 3,
HERMIONE,An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.,film 3,
HERMIONE,A werewolf has no choice.,film 3,
HERMIONE,With each full moon he no longer remembers who he is.,film 3,
HERMIONE,He'd kill his best friend.,film 3,
HERMIONE,"Furthermore, The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.",film 3,
SNAPE,"Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.",film 3,
SNAPE,"That's the second time you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger.",film 3,

SNAPE,Loss of limb will not excuse you.,film 3,
SNAPE,Page 394.,film 3,
SNAPE,"The term ""werewolf"" is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word ""were"" which means ""man,"" and ""wolf."" Werewolf, man-wolf.",film 3,

LUPIN,No? Well...A Patronus is a positive force.,film 3,
LUPIN,"For the wizard who conjures one it works like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him.",film 3,

LUPIN,That would have been remarkable.,film 3,
LUPIN,"Here, eat this. You'll feel better.",film 3,
HARRY,That's one nasty dementor.,film 3,
LUPIN,"Oh, no, no, no.",film 3,
LUPIN,"That was a boggart, Harry. A boggart.",film 3,
LUPIN,The real thing would be worse.,film 3,
LUPIN,"Much, much worse.",film 3,
LUPIN,"As a matter of interest, what were you thinking?",film 3,
LUPIN,Which memory did you choose?,film 3,
HARRY,The first time I rode a broom.,film 3,

HARRY,I was thinking of him. And Mum.,film 3,
HARRY,Seeing their faces.,film 3,
HARRY,They were talking to me.,film 3,
HARRY,Just talking.,film 3,
HARRY,That's the memory I chose.,film 3,
HARRY,I don't even know if it's real.,film 3,
HARRY,But it's the best I have.,film 3,
HERMIONE,Beautiful day.,film 3,

HAGRID,I got up and did my piece.,film 3,
HAGRID,"Said how Buckbeak was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers.",film 3,
HAGRID,And then Lucius Malfoy got up.,film 3,
HAGRID,"Well, you can imagine.",film 3,
HAGRID,He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill you as soon as look at you.,film 3,
HERMIONE,And then?,film 3,
HAGRID,"And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.",film 3,
RON,They're not sacking you!,film 3,
HAGRID,"No, I'm not sacked.",film 3,
HAGRID,Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!,film 3,
RON,Spiders! There's... There's spiders.,film 3,

SNAPE,"Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?",film 3,
LUPIN,"Harry, are you all right?",film 3,

SNAPE,Supposed to be your area of expertise.,film 3,
SNAPE,"Clearly, it's full of dark magic.",film 3,

LUPIN,I suspect it's a Zonko product.,film 3,
LUPIN,"Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess.",film 3,
LUPIN,"It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise.",film 3,
LUPIN,"Harry, would you come with me, please? Professor, good night.",film 3,

LUPIN,"Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black is a map to you?",film 3,
LUPIN,No.,film 3,
HARRY,"No, sir.",film 3,
LUPIN,Your father never set much store by the rules either.,film 3,
LUPIN,But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.,film 3,
LUPIN,Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them!,film 3,
LUPIN,"Now, I will not cover up for you again.",film 3,
LUPIN,Do you hear me?,film 3,
HARRY,"Yes, sir.",film 3,
LUPIN,I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.,film 3,

HAGRID,Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.,film 3,
HARRY,Why don't we just set him free?,film 3,

HAGRID,Says he wants to be with me when they...When it happens.,film 3,
HAGRID,"Great man, Dumbledore.",film 3,

HERMIONE,"The point is, we know the truth.",film 3,
HERMIONE,Please believe us.,film 3,
