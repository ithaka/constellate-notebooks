Character;Sentence
Dumbledore;I should've known that you would be here, Professor McGonagall.
McGonagall;Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.
McGonagall;Are the rumors true, Albus?
Dumbledore;I'm afraid so, professor.
Dumbledore;The good and the bad.
McGonagall;And the boy?
Dumbledore;Hagrid is bringing him.
McGonagall;Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?
Dumbledore;Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life.
Hagrid;Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Hagrid;Professor McGonagall.
Dumbledore;No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
Hagrid;No, sir.
Hagrid;Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol.
Hagrid;Try not to wake him.
Hagrid;There you go.
Dumbledore;Albus, do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people?
McGonagall;I've watched them all day.
McGonagall;They're the worst sort of Muggles, imaginable.
McGonagall;They really are...
Dumbledore;The only family he has.
McGonagall;This boy will be famous.
McGonagall;There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.
Dumbledore;Exactly.
Dumbledore;He's far better off growing up away from all of that.
Dumbledore;Until he's ready.
Dumbledore;There, there, Hagrid.
Dumbledore;It's not really goodbye, after all.
Dumbledore;Good luck...Harry Potter.
Petunia;Up. Get up!
Petunia;Now!
Dudley;Wake up, cousin!
Dudley;We're going to the zoo!
Petunia;Here he comes, the birthday boy.
Vernon;Happy birthday, son.
Petunia;Why don't you just cook the breakfast, and try not to burn anything.
Harry;Yes, Aunt Petunia.
Petunia;I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley's special day!
Vernon;Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
Harry;Yes, Uncle Vernon.
Petunia;Aren't they wonderful, darling?
Dudley;How many are there?
Vernon;36. Counted them myself.
Dudley;36?! But last year... last year I had 37!
Vernon;But some of them are quite a bit bigger than last year's.
Dudley;I don't care how big they are!
Petunia;Oh, now, now, now. 
Petunia;This is what we're going to do...
Petunia;is that when we go out, we're going to buy you two new presents.
Petunia;How's that, pumpkin?
Petunia;It should be a lovely day at the zoo.
Petunia;I'm really looking forward to it.
Vernon;I'm warning you now, boy.
Vernon;Any funny business, any at all...
Vernon;And you won't have any meals for a week.
Vernon;Get in.
Dudley;Make it move.
Vernon;Move!
Dudley;Move!
Harry;He's asleep!
Dudley;He's boring.
Harry;Sorry about him.
Harry;He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day...
Harry;...watching people press their ugly faces in on you.
Harry;Can you hear me?
Harry;It's just, I've never talked to a snake before.
Harry;Do you...?
Harry;I mean, do you talk to people often?
Harry;You're from Burma, aren't you?
Harry;Was it nice there?
Harry;Do you miss your family?
Harry;I see. That's me as well.
Harry;I never knew my parents either.
Harry;Mummy, Dad, come here! 
Dudley;you won't believe what this snake is doing!
Snake;Thanks.
Harry;Anytime.
Someone;Snake!
Dudley;Mum! Mummy! Help me!
Petunia;My darling boy!
Petunia;How did you get in there?
Petunia;Who did this?
Petunia;How did you get in there?
Petunia;ls there a snake?
Petunia;It's all right, sweetheart.
Petunia;We'll get you out of these cold clothes.
Vernon;What happened?
Harry;I swear, I don't know!
Harry;One minute the glass was there and then it was gone, it was like magic.
Vernon;There's no such thing as magic.
Petunia;And smile!
Petunia;Vernon, just look at him!
Petunia;I can't believe it!
Petunia;In just a week, he'll be off to Smeltings.
Vernon;Caveat Smeltonia.
Vernon;Proudest moment of my life.
Harry;Will I have to wear that too?
Petunia;What? You? Go to Smeltings?
Petunia;Don't be so stupid!
Petunia;You're going to go to the state school.
Petunia;Where you belong.
Petunia;This is what you'll going to be wearing, when I finish dyeing it.
Harry;That's Dudley's old uniform.
Harry;It'll fit me like bits of old elephant skin.
Petunia;It'll fit you well enough.
Petunia;Go get the post. Go!
Vernon;Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.
Dudley;Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
Harry;Hey, give it back! It's mine!
Vernon;Yours? Who'd be writing to you?
Vernon;No more mail through this letterbox.
Petunia;Have a lovely day at the office, dear.
Vernon;Shoo! Go on.
Vernon;Fine day, Sunday.
Vernon;In my opinion, best day of the week.
Vernon;Why is that, Dudley?
Harry;Because there's no post on Sundays?
Vernon;Right you are, Harry!
Vernon;No post on Sunday.
Vernon;No blasted letters today! No, sir.
Vernon;Not one single bloody letter. Not one!
Vernon;No, sir, not one blasted, miserable...
Dudley;Stop it!
Dudley;Mummy, what's happening?
Vernon;Give me that!
Vernon;Give me that letter!
Harry;Get off!
Harry;They're my letters!
Harry;Let go of me!
Vernon;That's it!
Vernon;We're going away!
Vernon;Far away, where they can't find us!
Dudley;Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?
Harry;Make a wish, Harry.
Vernon;Who's there?
Hagrid;Sorry about that.
Vernon;I demand that you leave at once, Sir!
Vernon;You are breaking and entering!
Hagrid;Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.
Hagrid;Mind, I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry.
Hagrid;But you're a bit more along than I would have expected.
Hagrid;Particularly 'round the middle.
Dudley;I'm not Harry.
Harry;I am.
Hagrid;Well, of course you are.
Hagrid;Got something for you.
Hagrid;Afraid I might have sat on it at somepoint, but I imagine it'll taste fine just the same.
Hagrid;Baked it myself, words and all.
Harry;Thank you.
Hagrid;It's not every day that your young man turns 11, now is it?
Harry;Excuse me, who are you?
Hagrid;Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.
Hagrid;Of course, you know all about Hogwarts.
Harry;Sorry, no.
Hagrid;No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?
Harry;Learnt what?
Hagrid;You're a wizard, Harry.
Harry;I'm a what?
Hagrid;A wizard.
Hagrid;And a thumping good one, I'd wager, once you're trained up little.
Harry;No, you've made a mistake.
Harry;I mean...l can't be a wizard.
Harry;I mean, I'm just Harry.
Harry;Just Harry.
Hagrid;Well, Just Harry, did you ever make anything happen?
Hagrid;Anything you couldn't explain, when you were angry or scared?
Harry;Dear Mr. Potter,
Harry;"We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."""
Vernon;He will not be going there!
Vernon;We swore when we took him in we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.
Harry;You knew? 
Harry;You knew all along and you never told me?
Petunia;Of course we knew.
Petunia;How could you not be?
Petunia;My perfect sister being who she was.
Petunia;My mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter.
Petunia;We have a witch in the family.
Petunia;"Isn't it wonderful?"""
Petunia;I was the only one to see her for what she was.
Petunia;A freak!
Petunia;Then she met that Potter, and then she had you...
Petunia;and I knew you would be the same.
Petunia;Just as strange, just as abnormal.
Petunia;And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up!
Petunia;And we got landed with you.
Harry;Blown up?
Harry;You told me my parents died in a car crash.
Hagrid;A car crash? 
Hagrid;A car crash killed Lily and James Potter?
Petunia;We had to say something.
Hagrid;It's an outrage!
Hagrid;It's a scandal!
Vernon;He'll not be going.
Hagrid;Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's going to stop him, are you?
Harry;Muggle?
Hagrid;Non-magic folk.
Hagrid;This boy's had his name down ever since he were born.
Hagrid;He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world and...
Hagrid;he'll be under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen, Albus Dumbledore.
Vernon;I will not pay to have some crackpot old fool teach him magic tricks.
Hagrid;Never insult Albus Dumbledore in front of me.
Hagrid;Oh, um, I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that.
Hagrid;Strickly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic.
Harry;Okay.
Hagrid;Ooh, We're a bit behind schedule.
Hagrid;Best be off.
Hagrid;Unless you'd rather stay, of course.
Harry;First year's students will require three sets of plain work robes one wand.
Hagrid;Essential bit of equipment, Harry.
Harry;One pair of dragon hide gloves.
Harry;Hagrid, Do they mean from a real dragon?
Hagrid;They don't mean a penguin, do they?
Hagrid;Crikey. I'd love a dragon.
Harry;You'd like a dragon?
Hagrid;Vastly misunderstood beasts, Harry.
Hagrid;Vastly misunderstood.
Harry;"All students must be equipped with one standard size 2 pewter cauldron and may bring, if they desire, either an owl, a cat or a toad."
Harry;Can we find all this in London?
Hagrid;If you know where to go.
Barkeep Tom;Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?
Hagrid;No, thanks, Tom.
Hagrid;I'm on official Hogwarts business.
Hagrid;Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies.
Barkeep Tom;Bless my soul.
Barkeep Tom;It's Harry Potter!
Man;Welcome back, Mr. Potter.
Man;Welcome back.
Witch;Doris Crockford, Mr Potter.
Witch;I can't believe I'm meeting you at last.
Quirrell;Harry Potter. Can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you.
Hagrid;Hello, professor. I didn't see you there.
Hagrid;Harry, This is Professor Quirrell. 
Hagrid;He will be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts
Harry;Oh, nice to meet you.
Quirrell;Fearfully fascinating subject.
Quirrell;Not that you need it, eh, Potter?
Hagrid;Yes, well, must be going now.
Hagrid;Lots to buy.
Harry;Goodbye.
Hagrid;See, Harry? You're famous.
Harry;But why am I famous, Hagrid?
Harry;All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?
Hagrid;I'm not sure I'm exactly the right person to tell you that, Harry.
Hagrid;Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.
Hagrid;Here's where you'll get your quills and your ink.
Hagrid;And over there, all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry.
Boy;It's a world-class racing broom.
Boy;Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!
Boy;It's the fastest model yet.
Harry;But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this?
Harry;I haven't any money.
Hagrid;Well there's your money, Harry.
Hagrid;Gringotts, the wizard bank.
Hagrid;Ain't no safer place, not one.
Hagrid;Except perhaps Hogwarts.
Harry;Hagrid, what exactly are these things?
Hagrid;They're goblins, Harry.
Hagrid;Clever as they come goblins but not the most friendly of beasts.
Hagrid;Best stay close.
Hagrid;Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal.
Goblin;And does Mr. Harry Potter have his key?
Hagrid;Oh, Wait a minute.
Hagrid;Got it here somewhere.
Hagrid;Ha! Here's the little devil.
Hagrid;Oh, and there's something else as well.
Hagrid;Professor Dumbledore gave me this.
Hagrid;It's about You-Know-What in vault you-know-which.
Goblin;Very well.
Griphook;Vault 687.
Griphook;Lamp, please.
Griphook;Key, please.
Hagrid;Didn't think your mum and dad will leave you with nothing, now did ya?
Griphook;Vault 713.
Harry;What's in there, Hagrid?
Hagrid;Can't tell you, Harry.
Hagrid;Hogwarts business. Very secret.
Griphook;Stand back.
Hagrid;Best not to mention this to anyone, Harry.
Harry;I still need... a wand.
Hagrid;A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders.
Hagrid;There ain't no place better.
Hagrid;Why don't you run along there and wait.
Hagrid; I just got one more thing I gotta do.
Hagrid; Won't be long.
Harry;Hello?
Harry;Hello?
Ollivander;I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.
Ollivander;It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands.
Ollivander;Here we are.
Ollivander;Give it a wave.
Ollivander;Apparently not.
Ollivander;Perhaps… this
Ollivander;No, no, definitely not.
Ollivander;No matter.
Ollivander;I wonder.. Curious.
Ollivander;Very curious.
Harry;Sorry, but what's curious?
Ollivander;I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.
Ollivander;It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather resides in your wand, gave another feather.
Ollivander;Just one other.
Ollivander;It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar. 
Harry;And who owned that wand?
Ollivander;We do not speak his name.
Ollivander;The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.
Ollivander;It's not always clear why.
Ollivander;But I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you.
Ollivander;After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things.
Ollivander;Terrible yes, but great
Hagrid;Harry! Harry!
Hagrid;Happy birthday.
Hagrid;You all right, Harry?
Hagrid;You seem very quiet.
Harry;He killed my parents, didn't he?
Harry;The one who gave me this.
Harry;You know, Hagrid. 
Harry;I know you do.
Hagrid;First, and understand this Harry because it's very important:
Hagrid;Not all wizards are good.
Hagrid;Some of them go bad.
Hagrid;A few years ago there was a one wizard who went as bad as he can go.
Hagrid; His name was V...
Hagrid;His name was V...
Harry;Maybe if you wrote it down?
Hagrid;No, I can't spell it.
Hagrid;All right, Voldemort.
Harry;Voldemort?
Hagrid;It was dark times, Harry. Dark times.
Hagrid;Voldemort started to gather some followers.
Hagrid;Brought them over to the Dark Side.
Hagrid;Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead.
Hagrid;Your parents fought against him.
Hagrid;But nobody lived once he decided to kill them.
Hagrid;Nobody, not one.
Hagrid;Except you.
Harry;Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?
Hagrid;Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry.
Hagrid;A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse, and an evil curse at that.
Harry;What happened to V...?
Harry;To You-Know-Who?
Hagrid;Well, some say he died.
Hagrid;Codswallop, in my opinion.
Hagrid;Nope, I reckon he's out there still too tired to carry on.
Hagrid;But one thing's absolutely certain. 
Hagrid;Something about you stumped him that night.
Hagrid;That's why you're famous.
Hagrid;That's why everybody knows your name.
Hagrid;You're the boy who lived.
Hagrid;What are you looking at?
Hagrid;Blimey, is that the time?
Hagrid;Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you.
Hagrid;Dumbledore will be wanting his...
Hagrid;Well, he'll be wanting to see me.
Hagrid;Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes.
Hagrid;Here's your ticket. 
Hagrid;Stick to it, Harry that's very important. 
Hagrid;Stick to your ticket.
Harry;Platform 9 3/4?
Harry;But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
Harry;This says platform 9 3/4.
Harry;There's no such thing, is there?
Man;Sorry.
Harry;Excuse me. Excuse me.
Trainmaster;Right on your left Madam.
Harry;Excuse me Sir, Can you tell me where I might find platform 9 3/4?
Trainmaster;9 3/4? Think you're being funny, do ya?
Mrs. Weasley;It's the same every year, packed with Muggles, Of course. 
Mrs. Weasley;Come on!
Harry;Muggles?
Mrs. Weasley;Platform 9 3/4, this way.
Mrs. Weasley;All right, Percy, you first.
Mrs. Weasley;Fred, you next.
George;He's not Fred, I am.
Fred;Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother?
Mrs. Weasley;Oh, I'm sorry, George.
Fred;I'm only joking. I am Fred.
Harry;Excuse me.
Harry;Could you tell me how to...?
Mrs. Weasley;How to get onto the platform?
Mrs. Weasley;Not to worry, dear.
Mrs. Weasley;It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well.
Mrs. Weasley;All you've got do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10.
Mrs. Weasley;Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.
Ginny;Good luck.
Ron;Excuse me. Do you mind?
Ron;Everywhere else is full.
Harry;No. Not at all.
Ron;I'm Ron, by the way.
Ron;Ron Weasley.
Harry;I'm Harry. Harry Potter.
Ron;So it's true!
Ron;I mean, do you really have the...?
Harry;The what?
Ron;The scar?
Ron;Wicked!
Woman;Anything off the trolley, dears?
Ron;No, thanks. I'm all set.
Harry;We'll take the lot.
Harry;Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
Ron;They mean every flavor.
Ron;There's chocolate and peppermint and there's also spinach, liver and tripe.
Ron;George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!
Harry;These aren't real frogs, are they?
Ron;It's just a spell.
Ron;Besides, It's the cards you want.
Ron;Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard.
Ron;I've got about 500 myself.
Ron;Watch it!
Ron;Oh, that's rotten luck.
Ron;They've only got one good jump in them to begin with.
Harry;I've got Dumbledore!
Ron;I got about six of him.
Harry;Hey, he's gone!
Ron;Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you?
Ron;This is Scabbers, by the way.
Ron;Pathetic, isn't he?
Harry;Just a little bit.
Ron;Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow.
Ron;Want to see?
Harry;Yeah.
Hermione;Has anyone seen a toad?
Hermione;A boy named Neville's lost one
Ron;No.
Hermione;Oh, are you doing magic?
Hermione;Let's see, then.
Ron;Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow.
Ron;Turn this stupid fat rat yellow.
Hermione;Are you sure that's a real spell?
Hermione;Well, it's not very good, is it?
Hermione;Of course, I've only tried a few simple ones myself but they've all worked for me.
Hermione;For example:
Hermione;Oculus Reparo.
Hermione;That's better, isn't it?
Hermione;Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!
Hermione;I'm Hermione Granger.
Hermione;And you are...?
Ron;I'm Ron Weasley.
Hermione;Pleasure.
Hermione;You two better change into robes.
Hermione;I expect we'll be arriving soon.
Hermione;You've got dirt on your nose, by the way.
Hermione;Did you know?
Hermione;Just there.
Hagrid;Right, then.
Hagrid;First years, this way, please!
Hagrid;Come on, now, first years, don't be shy.
Hagrid;Come on now, hurry up.
Hagrid;Hello, Harry.
Harry;Hey, Hagrid.
Hagrid;Right, then. This way to the boats.
Hagrid;Come on, now, follow me.
Ron;Wicked.
McGonagall;Welcome to Hogwarts.
McGonagall;Now, in a few moments, you'll pass through these doors and join your classmates.
McGonagall;But before you can take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses.
McGonagall;They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff Ravenclaw and Slytherin.
McGonagall;Now, while you're here, your house will be like your family.
McGonagall;Your triumphs will earn you points.
McGonagall;Any rule-breaking, and you will lose points.
McGonagall;At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup
Neville;Trevor! Sorry.
McGonagall;The Sorting Ceremony will begin momentarily.
Malfoy;It's true then, what they're saying on the train.
Malfoy;Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.
Whispers;Harry Potter?
Malfoy;This is Crabbe, and Goyle.
Malfoy;And I'm Malfoy.
Malfoy;Draco Malfoy.
Malfoy;Think my name's funny, do you?
Malfoy;I've no need to ask yours.
Malfoy;Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
Malfoy;You must be a Weasley.
Malfoy;We'll soon find out that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter.
Malfoy;You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort.
Malfoy;I can help you there.
Harry;I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks.
McGonagall;We're ready for you now.
McGonagall;Follow me.
Hermione;It's not real, the ceiling. 
Hermione;It's just bewitched to look like the night sky.
Hermione;I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.
McGonagall;All right, will you wait along here, please?
McGonagall;Now, before we begin Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words.
Dumbledore;I have a few start-of-term notices I wish to announce.
Dumbledore;The first years, please note that the Dark Forest is strictly forbidden to all students.
Dumbledore;Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch, has asked me to remind you that the third-floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death.
Dumbledore;Thank you.
McGonagall;When I call your name, you will come forth.
McGonagall;I shall place the Sorting Hat on your head and you will be sorted into your houses.
McGonagall;Hermione Granger.
Hermione;Oh, no. Okay, relax.
Ron;Mental, that one, I'm telling you.
Sorting Hat;Ah, right then... hmm... right.
Sorting Hat;Okay. Gryffindor!
McGonagall;Draco Malfoy.
Sorting Hat;Slytherin!
Ron;There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin.
McGonagall;Susan Bones.
Ron;Harry, what is it?
Harry;Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.
Sorting Hat;Let's see I know! Hufflepuff!
McGonagall;Ronald Weasley.
Sorting Hat;Another Weasley!
Sorting Hat;I know just what to do with you.
Sorting Hat;Gryffindor!
McGonagall;Harry Potter.
Sorting Hat;Hmm... difficult, very difficult.
Sorting Hat;Plenty of courage, I see.
Sorting Hat;Not a bad mind, either.
Sorting Hat;There's talent, oh, yes.
Sorting Hat;And a thirst to prove yourself.
Sorting Hat;But where to put you?
Harry;Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!
Sorting Hat;Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?
Sorting Hat;You could be great, you know.
Sorting Hat;It's all here, in your head.
Sorting Hat;And Slytherin will help you on the way to greatnesses, no doubt about that.
Sorting Hat;No? Well, if you're sure.
Sorting Hat;Better be...Gryffindor!
McGonagall;Your attention, please.
Dumbledore;Let the feast begin.
Seamus;I'm half and half.
Seamus;My dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.
Seamus;Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.
Harry;Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?
Percy;Oh, thats Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house.
Harry;What's he teach?
Percy;Potions.
Percy;But everyone knows, its the Dark Arts he fancies.
Percy;He's been after Quirrell's job for years.
Sir Nicholas;Hello! How are you?
Sir Nicholas;Welcome to Gryffindor.
Girl;Look, It's the Bloody Baron!
Percy;Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Percy;Have a nice summer?
Sir Nicholas;Dismal. Once again, my request to join the Headless Hunt has been denied.
Ron;I know you.
Ron;You're Nearly Headless Nick.
Sir Nicholas;I prefer Sir Nicholas, if you don't mind.
Hermione;Nearly headless?
Hermione;How can you be nearly headless?
Sir Nicholas;Like this.
Percy;Gryffindors, follow me please.
Percy;Keep up. Thank you.
Boy;Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.
Percy;This is the most direct path to the dormitories.
Percy;Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases.
Percy;They like to change.
Percy;Keep up, please, and follow me.
Percy;Quickly now, come on. Come on.
Neville;That picture's moving.
Ron;Look at that one.
Harry;I think she fancies you.
Girl;Oh, look! Look!
Girl;Who's that girl?
Man in paint;Welcome to Hogwarts.
Fat Lady;Password?
Percy;Caput Draconis.
Percy;Follow me, everyone. Keep up.
Percy;Quickly, come on.
Percy;Gather around here.
Percy;Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.
Percy;Boys' dormitory is upstairs and down to your left.
Percy;Girls, the same on your right.
Percy;You'll find that your belongings have already been brought up.
Ron;Made it!
Ron;Can you imagine the look on old McGonagall's face if we were late?
Ron;That was bloody brilliant!
McGonagall;Thank you for that assessment, Mr Weasley.
McGonagall;Perhaps, lt'd be more useful if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocket-watch.
McGonagall;That way, one of you might be on time.
Harry;We got lost.
McGonagall;Then perhaps a map?
McGonagall;I trust you don't need one to find your seats.
Snape;There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class.
Snape;As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making.
Snape;However, for those select few who possess the predisposition I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses.
Snape;I can tell you how to bottle fame brew glory and even put a stopper in death.
Snape;Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough to not pay attention.
Snape;Mr. Potter.
Snape;Our new celebrity.
Snape;Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?
Snape;You don't know? Well, let's try again.
Snape;Where, Mr Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar?
Harry;I don't know, Sir.
Snape;And what is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?
Harry;I don't know, Sir.
Snape;Pity.
Snape;Clearly, fame isn't everything is it, Mr. Potter?
Harry;Clearly, Hermione knows.
Harry;Seems a pity not to ask her.
Snape;Silence.
Snape;Put your hand down, you silly girl!
Snape;For your information, Potter
Snape;Asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of the Living Dead.
Snape;A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons.
Snape;As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite.
Snape;Well...
Snape;Why aren't you all copying this down?
Snape;And Gryffindors note that five points will be taken from your house for your classmate's cheek.
Seamus;Eye of rabbit, harp string hum
Seamus;Turn this water into rum.
Seamus;Eye of rabbit...
Harry;What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?
Ron;Turn it into rum. 
Ron;Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before...
Ron;Mail's here.
Harry;Can I borrow this? Thanks.
Dean;Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall
Hermione;I've read about those.
Hermione;When the smoke turns red, it means you've forgotten something.
Neville;The only problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten.
Harry;Hey Ron! Somebody broke into Gringotts.
Harry;Listen.
Harry;"Believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown Gringotts goblins while acknowledging the breach, insist nothing was taken."
Harry;"The vault in question, number 713, had, in fact, been emptied earlier that very same day."""
Harry;That's odd. 
Harry;That's the vault Hagrid and I went to.
Madam Hooch;Good afternoon, class.
Class;Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.
Madam Hooch;Good afternoon, Amanda.
Madam Hooch;Good afternoon.
Madam Hooch;Welcome to your first flying lesson.
Madam Hooch;Well, what are you waiting for? 
Madam Hooch;Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick.
Madam Hooch;Come on now, hurry up. 
Madam Hooch;"Stick your right hand over the broom and say, ""Up."""
Class;Up!
Malfoy;Up.
Ron;Up. Up!
Madam Hooch;With feeling.
Hermione;Up. Up. Up!
Ron;Shut up, Harry.
Madam Hooch;Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it.
Madam Hooch;And grip it tight, you don't wanna be sliding off the end.
Madam Hooch;When I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground, hard.
Madam Hooch;Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment
Madam Hooch;Then lean forward slightly and touch back down.
Madam Hooch;On my whistle. Three, two...
Madam Hooch;Mr. Longbottom.
Madam Hooch;Mr. Longbottom!
Neville;Down, down!
Class;Neville!
Madam Hooch;Come back down this instant!
Madam Hooch;Everyone out of the way!
Girl;Is he all right?
Madam Hooch;Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist.
Madam Hooch;Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.
Madam Hooch;Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr Longbottom to the hospital wing.
Madam Hooch;Understand? If I see a single broom in the air the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch.
Malfoy;Did you see his face?
Malfoy;Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze, he'd have remembered to fall on his fat arse.
Harry;Give it here, Malfoy.
Malfoy;No. I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find.
Malfoy;How about on the roof?
Malfoy;What's the matter, Potter?
Malfoy;Bit beyond your reach?
Hermione;Harry, no way!
Hermione;You heard what Madam Hooch said.
Hermione;Besides, you don't even know how to fly.
Hermione;What an idiot.
Harry;Give it here or I'll knock you off your broom!
Malfoy;Is that so?
Malfoy;Have it your way, then.
Boy;Nice going, Harry.
Boy;That was wicked, Harry!
McGonagall;Harry Potter!
McGonagall;Follow me.
McGonagall;You wait here.
McGonagall;Professor Quirrell, excuse me.
McGonagall;Could I borrow Wood for a moment please?
Quirrell;Oh, yes, of course.
McGonagall;Potter, this is Oliver Wood.
McGonagall;Wood, I have found you a Seeker.
Sir Nicholas;Have you heard? 
Sir Nicholas;Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker. 
Sir Nicholas;I always knew hed do well.
Ron;Seeker? 
Ron;But first years never make their house teams! 
Ron;You must be the youngest Quidditch player in
Harry ;A century, according to McGonagall.
Fred  ;Hey, well done, Harry, 
Fred  ;Wood's just told us!
Ron  ;Fred and George are on the team, too. 
Ron  ;Beaters.
George  ;Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too bad. 
George  ;Can't make any promises, of course. 
George  ;Rough game, Quidditch.
Fred  ;Brutal. 
Fred  ;But no one's died in years. 
Fred  ;Someone will vanish occasionally  
George  ;But they'll turn up in a month or two!!
Ron  ;Oh, go on, Harry, 
Ron  ;Quidditch is great. 
Ron  ;Best game there is! 
Ron  ;And you'll be great, too!
Harry  ;But I've never even played Quidditch. 
Harry  ;What if I make a fool of myself?
Hermione;You won't make a fool of yourself. 
Hermione;It's in your blood.
Ron  ;Whoa. 
Ron  ;Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too.
Harry  ;I-I didn't know.
Ron  ;I'm telling you, it's spooky. 
Ron  ;She knows more about you than you do.
Harry  ;Who doesn't?
Ron  ;Ahh!
Harry  ;What's happening?
Hermione  ;The staircases change, remember?
Harry;Let's go this way.
Ron ;Before the staircase moves again. 
Ron;Does anybody feel like...we shouldn't be here?
Hermione;We're not supposed to be here. 
Hermione;This is the 3rd floor. 
Hermione;It's forbidden.
Harry  ;Let's go.
Ron  ;It's Filch's cat!
Harry  ;Run! Quick, let's hide through that door!
Harry;It's locked!
Ron  ;That's it, we're done for!
Hermione  ;Oh, move over! 
Hermione;Alohomora
Hermione;Get in
Ron;Alohomora?
Hermione ;Standard book of spells, Chapter 7.
Filch;Anyone here, my sweet? Come on.
Hermione ;Filch is gone.
Ron ;Probably thinks this door's locked.
Hermione ; It was locked.
Harry  ;And for good reason. 
All  ;AHHHHHHH! 
Ron ;What do they think they're doing?? 
Ron ;Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.
Hermione ; You don't use your eyes, do you? 
Hermione ;Didn't you see what it was standing on?
Ron  ;I wasn't looking at its feet! 
Ron  ;I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. 
Ron  ;Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three!
Hermione  ;It was standing on a trap door. 
Hermione  ;Which means it wasn't there by accident. 
Hermione  ;It's guarding something.
Harry  ;Guarding something?
Hermione  ;That's right. 
Hermione  ;Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed...or worse, expelled!
Ron  ;She needs to sort out her priorities!
Oliver ;Quidditch is easy enough to understand. 
Oliver ;Each time has seven players, 3 chasers, 2 beaters, 1 keeper and a seeker that's you. 
Oliver ;There are three kinds of balls. 
Oliver ;This one's called the Quaffle.
Oliver ;Now, the chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops. 
Oliver ;The keeper, that's me, defends the hoops. 
Oliver ;With me so far?
Harry  ;I think so. 
Harry  ;What are those?
Oliver  ;You better take this. 
Oliver  ;Careful now, it's comin' back. 
Oliver  ;Eh, not bad, Potter, you'd make a fair beater...Uh-oh. 
Harry;What was that?
Oliver  ;Bludger. Nasty little buggers. 
Oliver  ;But you are a Seeker.
Oliver  ;The only ball I want you to worry about is this...the Golden Snitch. 
Harry ;I like this ball.
Oliver ;Ah, you like it now. 
Oliver ;Just wait. 
Oliver ;It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see.
Harry  ;What do I do with it?
Oliver  ;You catch it...before the other team's seeker. 
Oliver  ;You catch this, the game is over. 
Oliver  ;You catch this, Potter, and we win.
Harry  ;Whoa.
Flitwick;One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation the ability to make objects fly. 
Flitwick;Uh, do you all have your feathers? Good. 
Flitwick;Now, uh, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing, hmm? 
Flitwick;The swish and flick. Everyone. 
Class;The swish and flick. 
Flitwick;Good. 
Flitwick;And enunciate. 
Flitwick;Wingardium Leviosa. 
Flitwick;Off you go then.
Draco  ;Wingardium Levio-saaa.
Ron  ;Wingardrium Leviosar. 
Hermione  ;Stop, stop, stop.
Hermione  ;You're going to take someone's eye out. 
Hermione  ;Besides, youre saying it wrong. 
Hermione  ;It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.
Ron  ;You do it then if you're so clever. 
Ron  ;Go on, go on.
Hermione;Wingardium Leviosa.
Flitwick  ;Oh, well done! 
Flitwick  ;See here, everyone! 
Flitwick  ;Ms. Granger's done it! 
Flitwick  ;Oh, splendid!
Seamus  ;Wingard Levosa. Wingardly Lev... 
Flitwick  ;Whooaaa! Ooh.
Harry  ;I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor.
Ron  ;It's Leviosa, not Leviosar. 
Ron  ;Honestly, she's a nightmare. 
Ron  ;No wonder she hasn't got any friends!
Harry;I think she heard you.
Harry;Where's Hermione?
Neville;Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. 
Neville;She said that she'd been in there all afternoon...crying.
Quirrell;TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! 
Quirrell;T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON!! 
Quirrell;Thought you ought to know. 
Dumbledore;SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE!
Dumbledore; Everyone will please, not panic. 
Dumbledore;Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. 
Dumbledore;Teachers will follow me to the dungeons.
Girl  ;Hufflepuff, this way!
Boy  ;Stay together!
Percy  ;Gryffindors...keep up please. 
Percy  ;And stay alert!
Harry  ;How could a troll get in?
Ron  ;Not by itself. 
Ron  ;Trolls are really stupid. 
Ron  ;Probably people playing jokes.
Ron  ;What?
Harry ;Hermione! 
Harry ;She doesn't know!
Ron;I think the troll's left the dungeon.
Harry ;It's going into the Girl's Bathroom!
Harry  ;Hermione, move!
Hermione;Help! Help!
Ron  ;Hey, pea brain! 
Hermione ;Ahhh! Help!
Harry ;Whooa! Whoa, whoa! 
Harry  ;Do something!
Ron ;What?
Harry  ;Anything! 
Harry  ;Hurry up!
Hermione;Swish and flick!
Ron  ;Wingardium Leviosa! 
Ron  ;Cool!
Hermione  ;Is it...dead?
Harry  ;I don't think so. 
Harry  ;Just knocked out. 
Harry  ; Ew. Troll bogies.
McGonagall ;Oh! Oh, my goodness! 
McGonagall ;E-Explain yourselves, both of you!
Ron and Harry;Well, what it is...
Hermione  ;It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. 
McGonagall ; Ms. Granger?
Hermione  ;I went looking for the troll. 
Hermione  ;I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. 
Hermione  ;But I was wrong. 
Hermione  ;If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...
Hermione  ;I'd probably be dead.
McGonagall  ;Be that as it may...it was an extremely foolish thing to do. 
McGonagall  ;I would have expected more rational behaviour on your part and I am very disappointed in you Ms. Granger. 
McGonagall  ;5 points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment. 
McGonagall  ;As for you two gentlemen I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. 
McGonagall  ;Not many first year students could take on a full grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. 
McGonagall  ;5 points...will be awarded to each of you. 
McGonagall  ;For sheer dumb luck. 
Quirrell  ;Perhaps you ought to go...
Quirrell  ;M-might wake up...heh.Ahh! Hehe....
Harry;Good of you to get us out of trouble like that.
Ron;Mind you, we did save her life.
Harry;Mind you, she might not have needed saving if you hadn't insulted her.
Ron;What are friends for?
Ron;Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.
Hermione;Ron's right, Harry. 
Hermione;You're gonna need your strength today.
Harry  ;I'm not hungry.
Snape  ;Good luck today, Potter. 
Snape  ;Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin.
Harry  ;That explains the blood.
Hermione  ;Blood?
Harry  ;Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. 
Harry  ;But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping.
Hermione ; But why would anyone go near that dog?
Harry  ;The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults.
Harry  ; He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret.
Hermione ;So you're saying...
Harry ;That's what the dog's guarding. 
Harry ;That's what Snape wants.
Hermione  ;Bit early for mail, isn't it?
Harry  ;But I-I never get mail.
Ron  ;Let's open it.
Harry  ;It's a broomstick!
Ron  ;Thats not just a broomstick, Harry. 
Ron  ;It's a Nimbus 2000!
Harry  ;But who...?
OIiver  ;Scared, Harry?
Harry  ;A little.
Oliver  ;That's all right. 
Oliver  ;I felt the same way before my first game.
Harry  ;What happened?
Oliver  ;Er, I don't really remember. 
Oliver  ;I took a bludger to the head 2 minutes in. 
Oliver  ;Woke up in the hospital a week later.
Lee Jordan;Hello, and welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season! 
Lee Jordan;Today's game Slytherin versus Gryffindor!!!
Lee Jordan;The players take their positions as Madam Hooch steps out onto the field to begin the game.
Madam Hooch;Now, I want a nice clean game...from all of you. 
Lee Jordan;The bludgers are up...followed by the Golden Snitch. 
Lee Jordan;Remember, the snitch is worth 150 points. 
Lee Jordan;The seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game.
Lee Jordan;The Quaffle is released...and the game begins!
Lee Jordan;Angelina Johnson scores! 
Lee Jordan;10 points for Gryffindor! 
Harry  ;Yes! Whoa!
Hagrid ;Well done!
Lee Jordan;Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle.
Lee Jordan;Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.
Harry ;Yes!
Lee Jordan; Another 10 points to Gryffindor! 
Gryffindors  ;Yay!
Flint  ;Give me that! 
Crowd  ;Boooo!!
Flint;Take that side!
Harry  ;Whoa! Whooa!
Hagrid  ;What's going on with Harry's broomstick?
Hermione  ;It's Snape! 
Hermione  ;He's jinxing the broom!
Ron  ;Jinxing the broom? 
Ron  ;What do we do?
Hermione  ;Leave it to me. 
Ron  ;Come on, Hermione!
Hermione  ;Lacarnum Inflamarae.
Man  ;Fire! You're on fire!
Snape  ;What? Oh!
Ron  ;Go!
Hagrid  ;Go go go!
Hagrid;Looks like he's gonna be sick.
Lee  Jordan;He's got the Snitch! 
Lee  Jordan;Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!
Madam Hooch ;Gryffindor win!
All  ;YAY!
Draco  ;No!
Hagrid  ;Yes!
Hermione  ;Whoo-hoo!
Crowd  ;Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! 
Hagrid;Nonsense. 
Hagrid;Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?
Harry ;Who knows. 
Harry ;Why was he trying to get past that 3 headed dog on Halloween?
Hagrid  ;Who told you 'bout Fluffy?
Ron  ;Fluffy?
Hermione;That thing has a name?
Hagrid ; Well, of course he's got a name. 
Hagrid ;He's mine. 
Hagrid ;I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. 
Hagrid ;Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the
Harry  ;Yes?
Hagrid  ;Shouldn'ta said that.  No more questions!
Hagrid  ;Don't ask any more questions. 
Hagrid  ;That's top secret, that is.
Harry  ;But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it!
Hagrid  ;Codswallop. 
Hagrid  ;Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.
Hermione  ;Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a curse when I see one. 
Hermione  ;I've read all about them. 
Hermione  ;You have to keep eye contact. 
Hermione  ;And Snape wasn't blinking.
Harry ;Exactly.
Hagrid;Now, you listen to me, all three of you. 
Hagrid;You're meddlin' in things that ought not to be meddled in. 
Hagrid;It's dangerous.
Hagrid;What that dog is guarding is strictly between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.
Harry ;Nicholas Flamel?
Hagrid;I shouldn't have said that. 
Hagrid;I should not have said that. 
Hagrid;I should not have said that. 
Harry;Nicholas Flamel...Who's Nicholas Flamel?
Hermione;I don't know.
Harry;Knight to E-5.
Ron  ;Queen to E-5.
Hermione  ;That's totally barbaric!
Ron  ;That's wizard's chess. 
Ron  ;I see you've packed.
Hermione  ;See you haven't.
Ron  ;Change of plans. 
Ron  ;My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie. 
Ron  ;He's studying dragons there!
Hermione  ;Good. You can help Harry, then. 
Hermione  ;He's going to go the library for information on Nicholas Flamel.
Ron  ;We've looked a hundred times!
Hermione  ;Not in the restricted section...
Hermione  ;Happy Christmas.
Ron  ;I think we've had a bad influence on her.
Ron;Harry, wake up! 
Ron;Come on Harry, wake up!
Ron  ;Happy Christmas, Harry.
Harry  ;Happy Christmas, Ron. 
Harry  ;What are you wearing?
Ron  ;Oh, Mum made it. 
Ron  ;Looks like you've got one too!
Harry  ;I've got presents?
Ron  ;Yeah!
Harry  ;Oh! 
Ron  ;There they are. 
Harry  ;Your father left this in my possession before he died.
Harry  ;It is time it was returned to you.
Harry  ;Use it well.
Ron  ;What is it?
Harry  ;Some kind of...cloak.
Ron  ;Well, let's see then. 
Ron  ;Put it on.
Ron  ;Whoa!
Harry  ;My body's gone!
Ron  ;I know what that is! 
Ron  ;That's an invisibility cloak!
Harry  ;I'm invisible??
Ron;They're really rare. 
Ron;I wonder who gave it to you.
Harry;There was no name. 
Harry;"It just said, ""Use it well."""
Harry;Famous fire eaters...
Harry;15th Century Fiends...Flamel...
Harry;Nicholas Flamel...where are you?
Man  ;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
Filch;Who's there?! 
Filch;I know you're in there. 
Filch;You can't hide. 
Filch;Who is it? 
Filch;Show yourself!
Quirrell  ;Severus...I-I thought...
Snape  ;You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell.
Quirrell ; W-what do you m-mean?
Snape  ;You know perfectly well what I mean. 
Snape  ;We'll have another chat soon...
Snape  ;When you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.
Filch  ;Oh, Professors. I found this, in the Restricted Section. 
Filch  ;It's still hot. 
Filch  ;That means there's a student out of bed.
Harry  ;Mum? Dad? 
Harry  ;Ron! You've really got to see this! 
Harry  ;Ron! You've got to see this! 
Harry  ;Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!
Ron ;Why?
Harry  ;There's something you've got to see. 
Harry  ;Now, come on!
Harry  ;Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!
Ron  ;I only see us.
Harry;Look in properly. Go on. 
Harry;Stand there. There. 
Harry;You see them, don't you? 
Harry;Thats my dad
Ron  ;That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and 
Ron  ;I'm holding the Quidditch cup! 
Ron  ;And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! 
Ron  ;I look good. 
Ron  ;Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?
Harry  ;How can it? 
Harry  ;Both my parents are dead.
George  ;Do you like yours, Ron?
George  ;Ron?
Ron;I'll be right back.
Ron;Wanna play chess?
Harry;No.
Ron;Wanna go and visit Hagrid?
Harry;No.
Ron;Harry, I know what you're thinking, but don't.
Ron;There's something not right about that mirror.
Dumbledore  ;Back again, Harry?
Dumbledore  ;I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. 
Dumbledore  ;I trust by now you realize what it does. 
Dumbledore  ;Let me give you a clue. 
Dumbledore  ;The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is.
Harry  ;So, then it shows us what we want? 
Harry  ;Whatever we want?
Dumbledore  ;Yes...and no. 
Dumbledore  ;It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. 
Dumbledore  ;Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. 
Dumbledore  ;But remember this, Harry. 
Dumbledore  ;This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. 
Dumbledore  ;Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. 
Dumbledore  ;That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again.
Dumbledore  ;It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live.
Hermione;Look at you, playing with your cards.
Hermione;Pathetic!
Hermione;We've got final exams coming up soon.
Ron;I'm ready. Ask me any question.
Hermione;Alright, what are the 3 most crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?
Ron;I forgot.
Hermoine;And what, may I ask, do you plan to do if this comes up in the final exam?
Ron;Copy off you.
Hermoine;No, you won't.
Hermoine;Besides, according to Professor McGonagall, we're to be given special quills bewitched with an Anti Cheating Spell.
Ron;That's insulting! 
Ron;It's as if they don't trust us! Dumbledore again!
Ron;Leg-Locker Curse?
Harry;Malfoy.
Ron;You have got to start standing up to people, Neville.
Neville;How? I can barely stand at all!
Seamus;I'll do the countercurse!
Neville;No, that's all I need!
Neville;You to set my bloody kneecups on fire!
Seamus;I don't appreciate the insinuation, Longbottom.
Seamus;Besides, if anyone cared to notice my eyebrows have completely grown back!
Harry;I found him!
Ron;Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945.
Harry;Go on!
Ron;For the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon blood...and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicholas Flamel!
Harry;I knew the name sound familiar.
Harry;I read it on the train that day.
Hermione;Follow me!
Neville;Hey! Wait! Where are you going?
Neville;What about the countercurse?
Hermione  ;I had you looking in the wrong section! 
Hermione  ;How could I be so stupid? 
Hermione  ;I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.
Ron  ;This is light?
Hermione ;Of course! Here it is! 
Hermione ;Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!
Ron and Harry  ;The what?
Hermione  ;Honestly, don't you two read? 
Hermione  ;"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. "
Hermione  ;It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.
Ron  ;Immortal?
Hermione  ;It means you'll never die.
Ron ; I know what it means!
Harry; Shh!
Hermione ;The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!
Hermione ;That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. 
Hermione ;That's what's under the trapdoor...
Hermione ;the Philosopher's Stone!
Harry  ;Hagrid!
Hagrid;Oh, hello. Sorry, don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no fit state to entertain today. 
All 3  ;We know about the Sorcerer's Stone!
Hagrid ;Oh.
Harry  ;We think Snape's trying to steal it.
Hagrid  ;Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?
Harry  ;Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. 
Harry  ;We just don't know why.
Hagrid  ;Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! 
Hagrid  ;He's not about to steal it!
Harry  ;What?
Hagrid  ;You heard. Right. 
Hagrid  ;Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today.
Harry  ;Wait a minute.
Harry  ;One of the teachers?
Hermione;Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there?
Hermione;Spells and enchantments.
Hagrid  ;That's right. 
Hagrid  ;Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.
Hagrid  ;Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy. 
Hagrid  ;Hehe, not a soul knows how. 
Hagrid  ;Except for me and Dumbledore. 
Hagrid  ;I shouldn't have told you that. 
Hagrid  ;I shouldn't have told you that. 
Hagrid  ;Oh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! 
Harry  ;Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?
Hagrid  ;That? It's a ... its um...
Ron ; I know what that is! 
Ron ;But Hagrid, how did you get one?
Hagrid  ;I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. 
Hagrid  ;Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact.
Hermione  ;Is that...a dragon?
Ron  ;That's not just a dragon. 
Ron  ;That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! 
Ron  ;My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.
Hagrid  ;Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. 
Hagrid  ;He knows his mummy. Hehe. 
Hagrid  ;Hallo, Norbert.
Harry  ;Norbert?
Hagrid  ;Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he?
Hagrid  ;Don't you, Norbert? Dededede.
Hagrid  ;Ohh! Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...
Hagrid  ;He'll have to be trained up a bit, of course. 
Hagrid  ;Who's that?
Harry ;Malfoy.
Hagrid  ;Oh, dear.
Harry;Hagrid always wanted a dragon. 
Harry;He told me so the first time I met him.
Ron  ;It's crazy. 
Ron  ;And worse, Malfoy knows.
Harry  ;I don't understand. 
Hermione;Is that bad?
Ron  ;It's bad.
McGonagall;Good evening.
McGonagall  ;Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. 
McGonagall  ;Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken.
Harry  ;50?!
McGonagall ;Each. And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention.
Malfoy;Excuse me, Professor. 
Malfoy;Perhaps I heard you wrong. 
Malfoy;"I thought you said...""the four of us."""
McGonagall;No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. 
McGonagall;You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. 
McGonagall;You will join your classmates in detention.
Filch  ;A pity they let the old punishments die. 
Filch  ;There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. 
Filch  ;God, I miss the screaming. 
Filch  ;You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight.
Filch  ;He's got a little job to do inside the dark forest.
Filch  ;A sorry lot this, Hagrid. 
Filch  ;Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?
Hagrid ;Norbert's gone.
Hagrid ;Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.
Hermione  ;Well, that's good, isn't it? 
Hermione  ;He'll be with his own kind.
Hagrid  ;Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? 
Hagrid  ;What if the other dragons are mean to him?
Hagrid  ;He's only a baby, after all.
Filch  ;Oh, for Gods sake, pull yourself together, man. 
Filch  ;You're going into the forest, after all. 
Filch  ;Got to have your wits about you.
Malfoy;The forest? I thought that was a joke! 
Malfoy;We can't go in there. 
Malfoy;Students aren't allowed.
Malfoy; And there are...werewolves!
Filch ; There's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. 
Filch ;You can be sure of that.
Filch ;Nighty-night.
Hagrid ;Right. Let's go.
Harry ; Hagrid, what's that?
Hagrid  ;What we're here for. 
Hagrid  ;See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. 
Hagrid  ;I found one dead a few weeks ago. 
Hagrid  ;Now, this one's been injured bad by something. 
Hagrid  ;So, it's our job to find the poor beast. 
Hagrid  ;Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.
Ron;Okay.
Hagrid ;And Harry you'll go with Malfoy. 
Malfoy;Okay. Then I get Fang!
Hagrid ;Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward. }
Malfoy;You wait till my father hears about this. 
Malfoy;This is servant's stuff.
Harry ;If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared.
Malfoy;Scared, Potter?! 
Malfoy;Did you hear that? 
Malfoy;Come on, Fang.  Scared.
Harry ;What is it, Fang?
Malfoy;AHHHHHHHHH!!! AHHH! HELP!!!!!
Firenze  ;Harry Potter, you must leave. 
Firenze  ;You are known to many creatures here. 
Firenze  ;The forest is not safe at this time. 
Firenze  ;Especially for you.
Harry  ;But what was that thing you saved me from?
Firenze ;A monstrous creature. 
Firenze ;It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. 
Firenze ;Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. 
Firenze ;But at a terrible price. 
Firenze ;You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. 
Firenze ;A cursed life.
Harry  ;But who would choose such a life?
Firenze  ;Can you think of no one?
Harry ; Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...
Harry ;that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?
Firenze  ;Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?
Harry  ;The Sorcerer's Stone.
Hermione  ;Harry!
Hagrid ;Hello there, Firenze. 
Hagrid ;I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. 
Hagrid ;You all right there, Harry? 
Firenze  ;Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. 
Firenze  ;You're safe now. Good luck.
Hermione;You mean, You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?
Harry  ;But he's weak. 
Harry  ;He's living off the unicorns. 
Harry  ;Don't you see? We had it wrong. 
Harry  ;Snape doesn't want the stone for himself, he wants the stone for Voldemort. 
Harry  ;With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. 
Harry  ;He'll He'll come back. 
Ron  ;But if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?
Harry ; I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight.
Ron ; And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final!
Hermione  ;Hang on a minute.
Hermione  ;We're forgetting one thing. 
Hermione  ;Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?
Hermione  ; Dumbledore! 
Hermione  ;As long as Dumbledore's around, you're safe. 
Hermione  ;As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched. 
Hermione ; I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable.
Ron  ;Speak for yourself.
Ron  ; All right there, Harry?
Harry  ;My scar. It keeps burning.
Hermione  ;It's happened before.
Harry  ;Not like this.
Ron  ;Perhaps you should see the nurse.
Harry ; I think it's a warning.
Harry ; It means dangers coming. Uhh!  
Harry ;Oh. Of course!
Hermione ; What is it?
Harry  ;Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one?
Harry  ;I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? 
Harry  ;Why didn't I see it before? 
Harry  ;Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg?
Harry  ; What did he look like?
Hagrid  ;I don't know. 
Hagrid  ;I never saw his face. 
Hagrid  ;He kept his hood up.
Harry  ;The stranger, though, you and he must have talked.
Hagrid  ;Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. 
Hagrid  ;"I told him. I said, ""After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem."""
Harry ; And did he seem interested in Fluffy?
Hagrid ; Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy!
Hagrid ; How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade? 
Hagrid ;"But I told him. I said, ""The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him."
Hagrid ;" Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep."""
Hagrid;  I shouldn't have told you that.
Hagrid; Where you going?! Wait!
Harry ; We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!
McGonagall  ;I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. 
McGonagall  ;He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.
Harry  ;He's gone?! Now? 
Harry  ;But this is important! 
Harry  ;It's about...the Sorcerer's Stone.
McGonagall ;How do you know?
Harry  ;Someone's going to try and steal it.
McGonagall  ;I don't know how you three found out about the stone, but I can assure you it is perfectly well-protected. 
McGonagall  ;Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly. 
Harry  ;That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. 
Harry  ;It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy.
Hermione ; And with Dumbledore gone
Snape ; Good afternoon. 
Snape ;Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?
Hermione  ;Uh...we were just...
Snape  ;You want to be careful.
Snape  ;People will think you're up to something.
Hermione  ;Now what do we do?
Harry;We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.
Harry  ;Trevor.
Ron  ;Trevor shh!
Ron  ;Go, you shouldn't be here!
Neville;Neither should you. 
Neville;You're sneaking out again, arent you?
Harry  ;Now, Neville, listen. We were
Neville  ;No! I won't let you!
Neville  ; You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again!
Neville  ; I-I'll fight you.
Hermione ; Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this
Hermione ; Petrificus Totalus.
Ron;You're a little scary sometimes...you know that? 
Ron;Brilliant, but scary.
Harry ; Let's go. Sorry.
Hermione  ;Sorry.
Ron  ;It's for your own good, you know.
Hermione ;Ow! You stood on my foot!
Ron  ;Sorry.
Hermione  ;Alohomora.
Ron  ;Wait a minute...he's.... 
Harry;Snoring
Harry  ;Snape's already been here. 
Harry  ;He's put a spell on the harp.
Ron  ;Uh. It's got horrible breath!
Harry  ;We have to move its paw.
Ron  ;What?!
Harry  ;Come on! Okay. Push! 
Harry  ;I'll go first. 
Harry  ;Don't follow until I give you a sign.
Harry  ;If something bad happens, get yourselves out…
Harry  ;Does it seem a bit...quiet to you?
Hermione ;The harp. It stopped playing.
Ron  ;Ew! Yuck! Ugh. 
Harry  ;Jump! Go! 
Ron  ;Ahh! Whoa. 
Ron  ;Lucky this plant-thing is here, really.
Harry ;Whoa! Oh. Ahh!
Hermione ;Stop moving, both of you. 
Hermione ;This is Devil's Snare. 
Hermione ;You have to relax. 
Hermione ;If you don't, it will only kill you faster.
Ron  ;Kill us faster?! 
Ron  ;Oh, now I can relax!
Ron and Harry;  Hermione!!
Ron;Now what are we gonna do?!
Hermione;Just relax!
Harry  ;Hermione! Where are you?!
Hermione;Do what I say. Trust me. 
Ron ;Ahh! Harry!
Ron;Harry!
Hermione;Are you okay?
Harry ;Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
Ron ;Help!
Hermione  ;He's not relaxing, is he?
Harry  ;Apparently not.
Ron ;Help! Help me!
Hermione  ;We've got to do something!
Harry  ;What?
Hermione  ;Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology. 
Ron  ;Help!
Hermione;Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare,it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! 
Hermione;That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight!
Hermione;Lumus Solem!
Ron  ;Ahhh!
Harry ;Ron, are you okay?
Ron;Yeah.
Harry  ;Okay.
Ron;Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!
Harry  ;Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.
Hermione  ;What is that?
Harry;I don't know. 
Harry;Sounds like wings.
Hermione  ;Curious. I've never seen birds like these.
Harry  ;They're not birds, they're keys. 
Harry  ;And I'll bet one of them fits that door. 
Hermione ;What's this all about?
Harry  ;I don't know. Strange.
Ron   ;Alohomora! 
Ron   ;Well, it was worth a try.
Hermione  ;Ugh! What're we going to do? 
Hermione  ;There must be 1000 keys up there!
Ron  ;We're looking for a big old fashioned one. 
Ron  ;Probably rusty like the handle.
Harry  ;There! I see it!
Harry  ;The one with the broken wing!
Hermione  ;What's wrong, Harry?
Harry  ;It's too simple.
Ron  ;Oh, go on, Harry! 
Ron  ;If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! 
Ron  ;You're the youngest seeker in a century!
Ron  ;This complicates things a bit!
Harry  ;Catch the key!
Ron  ;Hurry up!
Hermione  ;I don't like this. 
Hermione  ;I don't like this at all.
Harry  ;Where are we? A graveyard.
Ron ;This is no graveyard. 
Ron ;It's a chessboard.
Harry ;There's the door.
Hermione  ;Now what do we do?
Ron ; It's obvious, isn't it? 
Ron ;We've got to play our way across the room. 
Ron ;All right. Harry, you take the empty Bishop's square. 
Ron ;Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. 
Ron ;As for me, I'll be a knight.
Hermione ;What happens now?
Ron;Well, white moves first, and then...we play. 
Hermione ;Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?
Ron  ;You there! D-5! 
Ron  ;Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!
Ron  ;Castle to E-4!  
Ron  ;Pawn to C-3!
Harry  ;Wait a minute.
Ron  ;You understand right, Harry. 
Ron  ;Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King.
Harry  ;No, Ron! No!
Hermione ; What is it?
Harry  ;He's going to sacrifice himself!
Hermione ;No, Ron, you can't!
Hermione ;There must be another way!
Ron;Do you want to stop Snape from getting that Stone or not?
Ron;Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. 
Ron;Not me, not Hermione, you. 
Ron;Knight...to H-3.
Ron  ;Check.
Ron  ;Ahhhh!
Harry  ;RON! 
Harry  ;NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing. 
Harry  ;Checkmate. 
Harry  ;Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. 
Harry  ;Send a message to Dumbledore. 
Harry  ;Ron's right...I have to go on.
Hermione  ;You'll be okay, Harry. 
Hermione  ;You're a great wizard, you really are.
Harry  ;Not as good as you.
Hermione;Me? Books and cleverness? 
Hermione;There are more important things. 
Hermione;Friendship, and bravery. 
Hermione;And Harry, just be careful.
Harry ;You? No. It can't be...Snape. He was the one
Quirrell ;Yes. He does seem the type, doesn't he? 
Quirrell ;"Next to him, who would suspect, ""p-p-poor s-stuttering Professor Quirrell?"""
Harry  ;B-but, that day, during the Quidditch Match, Snape tried to kill me.
Quirrell  ;No, dear boy. I tried to kill you! 
Quirrell  ;And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded. 
Quirrell  ;Even with Snape muttering his little counter-curse.
Harry  ;Snape was trying to...save me?
Quirrell ;I knew you were a danger right from the off. 
Quirrell ;Especially after Halloween.
Harry ;Th-then you let the troll in.
Quirrell  ;Very good Potter, yes. 
Quirrell  ;Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. 
Quirrell  ;While everyone else was running to the dungeon, he went to the 3rd floor to head me off. 
Quirrell  ;He, of course, never trusted me again.
Quirrell  ;He rarely left me alone. 
Quirrell  ;But he doesn't understand. 
Quirrell  ;I'm never alone. Never. 
Quirrell  ;Now...what does this mirror do? 
Quirrell  ;I see what I desire. 
Quirrell  ;I see myself holding the stone. 
Quirrell  ;But how do I get it?
Voldemort ;Use the boy
Quirrell  ;Come here, Potter, now!
Quirrell  ;Tell me. What do you see?
Quirrell ;What is it?! What do you see?!
Harry  ;I-I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. 
Harry  ;I've won the house cup.
Voldemort;He lies.
Quirrell;Tell the truth! What do you see?!
Voldemort;Let me speak to him.
Quirrell  ;Master, you are not strong enough.
Voldemort;I have strength enough for this. 
Voldemort;Harry Potter. We meet again.
Harry ;Voldemort.
Voldemort  ;Yes. You see what I have become? 
Voldemort  ;See what I must do to survive? 
Voldemort  ;Live off another. A mere parasite. 
Voldemort  ;Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. 
Voldemort  ;But there is something that can. 
Voldemort  ;Something, that conveniently enough, lies in your pocket!
Voldemort  ;Stop him! 
Voldemort  ;Don't be a fool! 
Voldemort  ;Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?!
Harry  ;Never!
Voldemort  ;Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. 
Voldemort  ;Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? 
Voldemort  ;Together, we can bring them back. 
Voldemort  ;All I ask for is something in return. 
Voldemort  ;That's it, Harry. 
Voldemort  ;There is no good and evil. 
Voldemort  ;There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. 
Voldemort  ;Together, we'll do extraordinary things. 
Voldemort  ;Just give me the stone! 
Harry  ;You liar!
Voldemort;Kill him!
Quirrell ;Ahh! Ahh! What is this magic?
Voldemort  ;Fool! Get the stone!
Quirrell;Ahhhhhhhhhh!
Voldemort  ;Arrrhhhhhh!
Harry  ;Ahhhhhhhhh!
Dumbledore ;Good afternoon, Harry. 
Dumbledore ;Ah. Tokens from your admirers?
Harry ;Admirers?
Dumbledore;What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. 
Dumbledore;Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs.
Harry ;Ron was here? 
Harry ;Is he all right? 
Harry ;What about Hermione?
Dumbledore  ;Fine. They're both just fine.
Harry ;But, what happened to the Stone?
Dumbledore  ;Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. 
Dumbledore  ;My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.
Harry;But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?
Dumbledore;He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. 
Dumbledore;But yes, he will die.
Harry  ;How is it I got the Stone, sir? 
Harry  ;One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next...
Dumbledore;Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. 
Dumbledore;That is one of my more brilliant ideas. 
Dumbledore;And between you and me thats saying something.
Harry  ;Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?
Dumbledore ;Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. 
Dumbledore ;Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him?
Dumbledore ;It was because of your mother. 
Dumbledore ;She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. 
Dumbledore ;No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen.
Dumbledore ;It lives in your very skin.
Harry ;What is it?
Dumbledore;Love, Harry, love. 
Dumbledore;Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. 
Dumbledore;I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. 
Dumbledore;But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee...
Dumbledore;Mm. Alas. Earwax.
Harry;All right there, Ron?
Ron;All right? You?
Harry;All right. Hermione?
Hermione;Never better.
Dumbledore;Another year gone. 
Dumbledore;And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus. 
Dumbledore;In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. 
Dumbledore;Third place, Hufflepuff, with 352 points. 
Dumbledore;In second place, Ravenclaw, with 426 points
Dumbledore;And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin House.
Students;Whoo! Yeah!
Malfoy;Nice one, Mate! 
Dumbledore ;Yes, yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. 
Dumbledore ;However, recent events must be taken into account. 
Dumbledore ;And I have a few last minute points to award. 
Dumbledore ;To Miss Hermione Granger, for the use of cool intellect when others were in great peril, 50 points. 
Harry;Good job.
Dumbledore;Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years...50 points. 
Dumbledore;And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house 60 points. 
Hermione;We're tied with Slytherin!
Dumbledore;And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. 
Dumbledore;I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom.
Dumbledore;Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of direction is in order. 
Dumbledore;Gryffindor wins the House Cup!
Hagrid;Yes!
Seamus;Yeah! We won!!
Hagrid;Come on now, hurry up. You'll be late. 
Hagrid;Train's leaving. 
Hagrid;Go on. Go on. Come on. Hurry up.
Hermione;Come on, Harry.
Harry;One minute. 
Hagrid;Thought you were leaving without saying good-bye, didja? 
Hagrid;This is for you.
Harry;Thanks, Hagrid. 
Hagrid;Oh. Go on...on with you. 
Hagrid;Oh, listen, Harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his.
Harry;But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that.
Hagrid;I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Eh? Off you go.
Hermione;Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?
Harry;I'm not going home. Not really.
