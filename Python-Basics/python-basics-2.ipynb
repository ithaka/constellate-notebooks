    "\n",
    "In *Python Basics 1*, you learned about [expressions](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#expression), [operators](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#operator), [variables](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#variable), and a few native [Python](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#python) [functions](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#). We wrote programs that executed line-by-line, starting at the top and running to the bottom. This approach works great for simple programs that may execute a few tasks, but as you begin writing programs that can do multiple tasks you'll need a way for your programs to decide which action comes next. We can control when (or if) code gets executed with [flow control statements](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#flow-control-statement). If a program is a set of steps for accomplishing a task, then [flow control statements](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#flow-control-statement) help the program decide the next action.\n",

    "[Flow control statements](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#flow-control-statement) work like a flowchart. For example, let's say your goal is to hang out and relax with friends. There are a number of steps you might take, depending on whether your friends are available or you feel like making some new friends.\n",

This means that one (and only one) [flow control statement](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#flow-control-statement) is executed when using `elif` statements. The fact that only one `elif` statement is executed is important because it may be possible for multiple [flow control statements](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#flow-control-statement) to evaluate to **True**. A series of `elif` statements evaluates from top-to-bottom, only executing the first `elif` statement whose condition evaluates to **True**. The rest of the `elif` statements are skipped over (whether they are **True** or **False**).\n",

    "1. A series of `elif` statements helps someone reading your code understand that a single flow control choice is being made.\n",
    "2. Using `elif` statements will make your program run faster since other conditional statements are skipped after the first evaluates to **True**. Otherwise, every `if` statement has to be evaluated before the program moves to the next step.\n",
