    "# Introduction to Jupyter AI\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Jupyter AI extension](https://jupyter-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is useful for two reasons. First, it contains a chatbot named Jupyternaut which opens in a separate pane. The chatbot application can help you write code by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Answering general programming questions\n",
    "* Answering specific questions about your code\n",
    "* Answering specific questions about your files\n",
    "* Suggesting improvements to your code\n",
    "* Writing a basic notebook from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the Jupyter AI extension contains a series of Python \"magic commands\" that can be used *inside a notebook* to connect with various AI models. Jupyternaut is like a helpful assistant that answers questions, but the magic commands connect your notebook to a large variety of models for particular text analysis tasks such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Text classification\n",
    "* Question Answering\n",
    "* Feature Extraction\n",
    "* Text Generation\n",
    "* Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "* Translation\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, you can use these magic commands for multi-modal tasks, such as turning text into an image or audio into text. The Jupyter magic commands offer a way to easily *switch between* models with a minimum amount of code and complexity. In the next lesson, we will examine how to work with Hugging Face models in a more sophisticated fashion with specialized Python libraries."

    "# Jupyternaut\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Jupyternaut, you need to connect the chatbot to a provider and then issue questions and/or commands. Let's look at each of these tasks separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connecting Jupyternaut to a Provider\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood, the Jupyternaut chatbot interface must be powered by an AI infrastructure provider. The speed and quality of Jupyternaut depends on the provider and model chosen. Some options include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [AI21 Labs](https://www.ai21.com/)\n",
    "* [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/)\n",
    "* [Amazon Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)\n",
    "* [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service)\n",
    "* [Cohere](https://cohere.com/)\n",
    "* [ERNIE Bot](http://research.baidu.com/Blog/index-view?id=183)\n",
    "* [GPT4All](https://www.nomic.ai/gpt4all) (early stage)\n",
    "* [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)\n",
    "* [Open AI](https://openai.com/index/openai-api/)\n",
    "* [Together AI](https://www.together.ai/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most providers offer access to high-speed compute (far beyond consumer-grade computers) and simplified infrastructure for model flexibility. For example, a provider like Open AI makes it trivial to switch between state-of-the-art models to inexpensive models.  These services usually come with a cost; you will need a credit card to use them. The cost for running Jupyternaut can be measured in fractions of a cent per response. \n",
    "\n",
    "When using a provider, you will need an API Key. The API Key is like a password, and it should not be shared publicly. When you run Python code that connects to the provider's servers, the API Key tells them you are authorized to make the request and the account that should be billed for the compute. If your API Key is compromised, another person could make requests and your account would be billed. For this reason, we recommend to set limits on your account and not let any provider \"auto-recharge\" your credit balance. $10 is plenty to get started with a model provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyternaut is also beginning to support some free options, such as GPT4All and Hugging Face. If you happen to have a high-end computer with multiple GPUs already, running some medium-sized models may be possible using GPT4All or Hugging Face. A better performance option is to outsource the heavy lifting to industrial, server-grade hardware through an API. The cost to use an API is tiny compared to building a high-end, research computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we demonstrate how to work with three providers: GPT4All, Hugging Face, and Open AI."

    "GPT4All is a model provider focused on privacy, local installations, and \"open-source\" language models. Support for GPT4All with Jupyternaut and Jupyter AI is still under development. Expect it to be slow and a little buggy. The benefit is that GPT4All is free and runs models on local hardware. It may be a suitable solution for working with smaller models on a powerful consumer-grade computer, but the results will be slower and poorer quality compared to large language models hosted on commercial-grade infrastructure."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "The Jupyter AI extension offers a simple path to getting started with a variety of models. The Jupyternaut chatbot is a helpful assistant for writing code and the Jupyter Magic commands can quickly connect your notebooks to the model of your choice. There's a lot more to discover, so it is definitely worth checking out the [Jupyter AI Documentation](https://jupyter-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter AI extension was released in August of 2023, so it is still very young and under active development. Jupyter AI excels at creating a simple interface for basic access to models. However, model development is moving at a breakneck pace, and it is common to run into issues with models, especially from Hugging Face since there are literally hundreds of thousands to choose from. Some models use non-standard methods which do not work with Jupyter AI, sometimes models change their API causing Jupyter AI Magics to fail with a model that worked perfectly fine a week ago, and models can require more sophisticated interaction than the interface can offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our next class, we will look at how to access models in a more sophisticated and flexible fashion. You will learn how to find and deploy models with Python code, opening up an enormous world of possibilities for research. "
