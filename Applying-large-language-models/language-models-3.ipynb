    "# Introduction to Retrieval Augmented Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on an enormous variety of content, including books, wikipedia, and social media. They are often able to answer basic questions in a wide-ranging variety of contexts. Researchers, on the other hand, tend to specialize in their research area—going deep rather than wide. Researchers also tend to be interested in the latest articles and research in their field, while language models “knowledge” is frozen in time once trained. (There are some ways to update the knowledge in a language model, but they can be impractical.) Finally, researchers are concerned with citation and reference. In brief, *LLMs often lack knowledge that is specialized, current, and citable*: the type of knowledge researchers want most.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), formalized in “Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks” ([Lews, et. al 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401)), has emerged as a solution for these problems. While other methods have focused on adapting an existing model, RAG introduces a new step into the process: retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the retrieval step, the user’s query is matched with a vector database of reference documents (called a “knowledge base”) in order to find document chunks that are likely to contain the answer. Once the document chunks have been retrieved, they can be submitted as context with the user’s query to the LLM. \n",
    "\n",
    "![The steps of RAG described below in visual form.](https://ithaka-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/static-files/images/tdm/tdmdocs/rag-process.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "While RAG systems can be quite sophisticated, the basic steps remain the same:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User submits a query\n",
    "2. Relevant document chunks are returned from the vector database\n",
    "3. A prompt containing the chunks is submitted to the LLM with the user’s query\n"

At the current time, some research suggests RAG has a more profound effect than fine-tuning.
