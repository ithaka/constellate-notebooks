    "# Introduction to Retrieval Augmented Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on an enormous variety of content, including books, wikipedia, and social media. They are often able to answer basic questions in a wide-ranging variety of contexts. Researchers, on the other hand, tend to specialize in their research area—going deep rather than wide. Researchers also tend to be interested in the latest articles and research in their field, while language models “knowledge” is frozen in time once trained. (There are some ways to update the knowledge in a language model, but they can be impractical.) Finally, researchers are concerned with citation and reference. In brief, *LLMs often lack knowledge that is specialized, current, and citable*: the type of knowledge researchers want most.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), formalized in “Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks” ([Lews, et. al 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401)), has emerged as a solution for these problems. While other methods have focused on re-training an existing model, RAG introduces a new step into the process: retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the retrieval step, the user’s query is matched with a vector database of reference documents (called a “knowledge base”) in order to find document chunks that are likely to contain the answer. Once the document chunks have been retrieved, they can be submitted as context with the user’s query to the LLM. \n",
    "\n",
    "![The steps of RAG described below in visual form.](../All-sample-files/rag-process.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "While RAG systems can be quite sophisticated, the basic steps remain the same:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User submits a query\n",
    "2. Relevant document chunks are returned from the vector database\n",
    "3. A prompt containing the chunks is submitted to the LLM with the user’s query\n"

At the current time, some research suggests RAG has a more profound effect than fine-tuning. In other words, RAG may improve LLM benchmark scores by a greater degree than other techniques, but the highest scores usually come from a combination of techniques.\n",

This seachange compelled Open AI to release a new API [Responses](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses), which will be the eventual successor to the [Chat Completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) API. With this shift, Open AI is planning to create more built-in tools for web search, file search, and computer use. The differences in the two APIs are detailed in the [Open AI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/responses-vs-chat-completions).\n",

    "# The Building Blocks of Agentic Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "The Responses API is designed with agent tasks and workflows in mind, prioritizing web search alongside new tools such as file search, computer use, and a forthcoming code interpreter. The concept is that agent models do not respond simply by providing text, images, or content, but that they work actively to solve problems. This could require multiple steps or multiple models working together on a task. \n",
    "\n",
    "A recent post by Anthropic [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents) describes the recent shift into agentic systems with two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Workflows** are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.\n",
    "* **Agents**, on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflows are almost always the better choice since they define a clear process for using particular tools at particular times with clear end states. Some workflows include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Building Block**- An LLM is augmented with additional tools and retrieval such as Retrieval Augmented Generation\n",
    "* **Prompt Chaining**- A series of LLM prompts are chained together with a \"gate\" to check progress after each step is completed\n",
    "* **Routing**- A specialized router or triage agent routes the task through to a particular agent designed for the task\n",
    "* **Parellelization**- Multiple LLMs run similar tasks at the same time. The results are then either combined into a single result or voted on for the best solution\n",
    "* **Orchestrator-workers**- A central LLM breaks down a task and then assigns it to worker LLMs before synthesizing the results\n",
    "* **Evaluator-optimizer**- One LLM generates solutions and works in tandem with an evaluator/optimizer, improving a solution through successive iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "These workflows can be connected in sophisticated pathways to accomplish difficult tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In distinction, **Agents** \"...are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.\" Since the agent is making strategic decisions on the process, tools, and solution-state, the results of agents can be highly variable.

The data storage does have a small cost: \"You first GB is free and beyond that, usage is billed at $0.10/GB/day of vector storage. There are no other costs associated with vector store operations\" ([File Search Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/file-search). There are arguably better players in this space, and it is not too hard to build a RAG system (as we demonstrated above). However, the nice thing about this service is it allows Open AI to be a one-stop shop for your models and your data.\n",

    "It is still very early days for computer use models, but Open AI's Computer-Using Agent (CUA) model shows promise. Basically, the CUA model operates in a loop. An image is sent to the model and then it can take an action such as: clicking, typing, or scrolling. After each action, a new image is sent to the model, so it can decide what choice to make next. The CUA model can use a browser automation framework such as [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) or [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) to control a web browser on your machine. The CUA Model can also control a local virtual machine through [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).\n",
