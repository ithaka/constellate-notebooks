    "## Choosing a Model\n",
    "In the previous class, we used Jupyter AI and Jupyter Magics to interact with foundation models designed for general purpose tasks. Today, we will consider the wider variety of models available and how to get started with them. Here are some questions to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the task you are trying to accomplish?\n",
    "There are models designed for a wide variety of research tasks. The models on Hugging Face work in a variety of modalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Natural Language Processing**: text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, summarization, translation, multiple choice, text generation, vector databases\n",
    "* **Computer Vision**: image classification, object detection, segmentation\n",
    "* **Audio**: automatic speech recognition, audio classification\n",
    "* **Multimodal**: table question answering, optical character recognition, information extraction from scanned documents, video classification, visual question answering, text to audio/image/video\n",
    "\n",
    "### Can you use an existing model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Models are trained on a particular dataset. If your data is similar to the material in the model's training data, you may be able to use the model \"off-the-shelf\" without any changes. The process of using a model is called \"inference\", and it uses significantly less resources than training a model from scratch or \"fine-tuning\" an existing model. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What kind of compute is necessary for the task?\n",
    "\n",
    "If a model has already been trained to do your task, then you can simply run inference on the existing model. If your data is slightly different than the model's training data, you may be able to \"fine-tune\" it to work better with your data. If you need a model to do a new kind of task, you may need to train it from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Very large models and/or complex tasks require more resources. While simple models can be run locally on a modest laptop, a very big model or complex task may require a high-end computer or server-grade hardware. It's a fool's errand to use too small of a model or low-grade hardware for a difficult task, but it is also a waste to use too much model or hardware for a simple task. The best way to discover if you have a good fit is to try running a variety of tasks before throwing all your data at the model. Sometimes, it may make sense to use different models for different parts of the data or to fine-tune an existing model. Training a model from scratch can be reasonable if you have lots of high-quality, labeled data and access to significant compute resources."

While it can be a bit thin on the overall depth of story, it more than makes up for this with big action set pieces, great oneliners and jokes throughout, along with giving us some of the most exhilarating cameos the MCU has seen yet.

    "Sam and Sadie met when they are kids and quickly bonded over their love of video games. They develop a friendship that spans almost 30 years. The novel follows the highs and lows of their friendship, including falling in love, falling out, a love triangle, successes, and failures. Throughout it all, the one constant in their lives is video games.\n",
    "The narrative alternates primarily between Sadie and Sam's POVs. Sam and Sadie are both loveable, arrogant, infuriating, and flawed. The dynamics of their friendship are complicated by love, jealousy, and misunderstanding. I got a little sick of the friends to frenemies cycle between Sadie and Sam (more of Sadie’s anger towards Sam, but I understood her point of view). I loved them, but I also wanted to shake some sense in them.\n",
    "Sam’s mother, Anna; Marx, Sam’s college roommate; Dov, Sadie's professor; are some additional characters who make an impact. My favorite characters were Sam’s grandparents, Dong Hyun and Bong Cha.\n",
    "The novel blends reality and game worlds, and parts of the narrative take place in a virtual open world.\n",
    "All characters are well-developed and multidimensional. Even the avatars are multidimensional.\n",
    "I am not a huge fan of video games, but this book made me nostalgic for the video games of my childhood. I got all of the Oregon Trail and Mario references, but there were times that I was a little lost, but I didn’t mind because I learned so much about gaming. The reader doesn’t need to know much about video games to enjoy this book (but it might help!). There are also a lot of 80s, 90s, and early 2000s pop culture references mixed in. I loved reading the details behind creating a game and the gaming industry as I was introduced to a whole new world.\n",
    "This is a well-written, complex, thought-provoking, and original novel. I was invested in the characters, and some moments hit me on an emotional level. I got teary-eyed towards the end. I won't forget these characters; this is a book that is going to stay with me for a long time.\n",

    "This book is so utterly pretentiousness and trying so hard to be woke that I should have given up on it instead of seeing it to the end. I would have if the beginning hadn’t been so beautifully done. There’s a line in the book about a video game sequel being awful because it was farmed out to Indian programmers who had no interest in the game and that’s how this book feels after the incredible start.\n",
    "\n",
    "The story began with Sadie and Sam central to the story. Sam was the obviously the more sympathetic of the two and the one you as a reader care about. Sadie was often annoying and then fell apart in a ridiculous way. I hoped her awful college self with the horrible college boyfriend would evolve and grow up but she never does. Even worse for the story is the tangents that from that point became the story. We suddenly get a new character who is rightly called boring later on. He is a NPC. He’s just too good and uninteresting to take up so much space. We get his backstory we don’t need. In a similar way later on we get two new characters that happen to be gay that bring nothing to the story other than a celebration of their sexuality which apparently is worth their inclusion. Much like tangents about their game that take up unnecessary page time and continue to dilute any attempt at storytelling. There’s plenty of politics, even to a ridiculously degree like actual comical bad guys intent on violence against those in favor of gay relationships and marriage. Ironically for a book full of wokeness with characters never being straight, celebrating gender fluidity, the book managed to ridicule cultural appropriation. The book is very focused on the race of the characters but never explores them in more than a superficial way.\n",
    "One of the author’s worst faults was her pretentious word choices. Instead of writing in way that flowed she chose to constantly check her thesaurus for jarring words like jejune and verdigris every couple of pages. Ironically much like the criticism of a game her character created this book is pretentious and full of itself. The worst part is that could have been amazing if it had stayed as focused as it was in the beginning. This is not a story worth the journey so do not push play. I received a complimentary copy of this book.\n",

I spent as much time watching cutscenes and having dialogue spewed at me as playing the game, it felt like. The alternating management/action sections sounded interesting in the reviews I watched, but playing them was much slower and more monotonous than I would have anticipated. It's definitely the kind of game for which I'm thankful that Steam offers a 2 hour refund window.\n",
