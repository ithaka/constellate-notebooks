    "## Methods for Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis can help an analyst discover whether feedback is positive, negative, or mixed. For example, a large company like Amazon or Walmart could use sentiment analysis on user reviews to determine whether a featured product should be promoted or discontinued. Sentiment analysis generally falls into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rule-based algorithms\n",
    "* Machine Learning models \n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule-Based Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Rule-based algorithms assign sentiment scores to particular words or multi-word constructions. Simple algorithms may simply assess each word individually in a feedback document and add up an overall score. More complex algorithms may assess multi-word (or n-gram) constructions and have special rules for addressing issues such as negation, emojis, and emoticons. They can detect the difference between \"bad\", \"not bad\", and \"bad ass\". Some algorithms also support emojis and emoticons, such as \"=)\" and \"😁\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning models rely on feedback data that has already been assessed by humans to have a particular sentiment. Each piece of feedback is **labeled** by a human reader who may place the feedback into a particular category. The categories could be as simple as positive, negative, or neutral. As long as there exists **labeled** data, a machine learning model can often identify complex concepts. For example, a car manufacturer may desire to classify the sentiment of feedback from past buyers as: \"budget-conscious\", \"eco-conscious\", \"tech-enthusiastic\", \"luxury-driven\", \"performance-driven\", etc. Assuming there is an adequately labeled **training data** for each of these categories, a machine learning model could assign a score for each category. This could help analysts understand the brand better, answering questions about what consumers do or do not like about a particular vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the humanities, sentiment analysis could be used to track emerging trends on social media. For example, we might ask: \"How are Twitter or Reddit users responding to a particular government policy or public event?\" We could look at a hashtag like \"#blm\" and get a sense of national sentiment on the Black Lives Matter movement. The project [On the Books: Jim Crow and Algorithms of Resistance](https://onthebooks.lib.unc.edu/) is using machine classification to detect racist laws based on the pioneering work of [Pauli Murray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_Murray) and [Safiya Noble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safiya_Noble)'s concept of \"algorithmic oppression\".

    "## VADER\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses a rule-based algorithm named VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner). VADER is a rule-based algorithm that is \"specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media.\" It relies on a specialized **lexicon** of words, phrases, and emojis. Each token in the lexicon is assigned a \"mean-sentiment rating\" between -4 (extremely negative) to 4 (extremely positive). Here are a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Token|Mean-Sentiment Rating|\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "|(:|2.2|\n",
    "|/:|-1.3|\n",
    "|):<|-1.9|\n",
    "|rotflmao|2.8|\n",
    "|aghast|-1.9|\n",
    "|awesome|3.1|\n",
    "|awful|-2.0|\n",
    "\n",
    "There are over 7500 tokens listed in VADER lexicon. (You can also add your own if you like.) VADER also considers grammatical and syntactical rules to measure intensity based on word order and sensitive relationships between terms. For example, it increases or decreases a sentiment based on degree modifers such as: \"The product is good\" versus \"the product is very good\" versus \"the product is marginally good.\" To read more about VADER, including how it works and to see its code, [visit the github page](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment)."
