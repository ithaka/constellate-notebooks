    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a high-level overview of common text analysis methods used in academic research. In particular, this notebook describes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Common text analysis methods useful for academic research\n",
    "* The kind of research questions each method can answer\n",
    "* How difficult each method is to learn\n",
    "* Constellate events and open educational resources\n",
    "* Additional learning resources\n",
    "\n",
    "Text analysis has emerged from many research areas (computer science, linguistics, information science, social sciences, and computational humanities, to name a few) to help address the over-abundance of data. When a single scholar—or even a team of dozens of scholars—is confronted with millions of documents, it becomes impossible to read all the available evidence. This is true whether the documents are full-length monographs or tweets. The challenge of informational synthesis becomes more difficult as the research record grows larger with each passing day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text analysis is part of a generational shift in the toolkit of 21st-century researchers. Textual research methods play an important role in helping address our post-modern data deluge. No matter the field, all academics are increasingly confronted by data overload. From students to academic leaders, the \"data problem\" has taken center stage: ChatGPT, Large Language Models, Machine Learning, Big Data, Neural Networks. Whether academics use these technologies for their research or not, they increasingly underpin the systems we use for knowledge-making. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thriving in this universe of information requires learning digital literacies, ways of seeing the size, scope, and shape of human thought. Text analysis then, is not just a field or set of methods, but a growing body of textual literacies that help us connect, discover, and interpret humanity's knowledge at a superhuman scale. Like a researcher operating a telescope, knowing the right methods can maake the difference between a shot in the dark and a glimpse into the richness of newfound galaxies and constellations."

    "## Text Analysis Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Text analysis creates insights from a large number of texts (also known as a corpus). Some texts may be ready for analysis and others may require thousands of hours for preparation. All research has time and funding restraints, so understanding the difference is important for determining whether a project is feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research projects that start with printed documents can be prohibitively expensive in time and labor. Assuming the printed documents can be scanned accurately into a suitable image (`.jpg`, `.tiff`, etc.) or portable document format (`.pdf`), the researcher will then need to convert the file using a process known as Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The process can be semi-automated, but high-quality, accurate results at scale almost always require significant human labor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is easier to start with \"born-digital\" materials, many researchers gather data from:\n",
    "* Pre-existing datasets\n",
    "* Scraping from websites\n",
    "* Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)\n",
    "If the data has a consistent structure, the relevant text can probably be extracted at-scale with some Python literacy. \n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, the ideal scenario is having texts in an easily readable format, such as a plaintext file, e.g. a `.txt` file extension. Document formats such as Extensible Markup Langauge `.xml` or JavaScript Object Notation `.json` can be even richer sources of data, especially if they contain relevant metadata such as titles, authors, publishers, dates, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, since text analysis methods rely on statistical models, it is generally true that having more texts will improve the outcomes of your analysis."

    "### What about copyright law?\n",
    "\n",
    "Text analysis on copyrighted materials poses an additional challenge. It is not possible to secure the copyrights for millions of documents. There are two common approaches to this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Analyze the data within a **secure computing environment**\n",
    "2. Use a **non-consumptive dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC) offers two approaches. Researchers who need full-text access, can use a secure computing environment known as an HTRC [data capsule](https://wiki.htrc.illinois.edu/display/COM/HTRC+Data+Capsule+Environment). The primary benefit is that researchers can work with full-text data directly in the environment. The capsule monitors data that is exported, ensuring that copyright is observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some significant downsides to this secure computing approach. Most notably, researchers must bring their tools into the environment, and they are limited by the technical specifications of the secure compute environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these issues, HTRC also offers a non-consumptive dataset called [\"Extracted Features\"](https://analytics.hathitrust.org/datasets). Users can download the non-consumptive dataset to their machine (~4 TB in size). The dataset does not contain full-text (ensuring copyright is observed), but it does contain [n-gram](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#n-gram) counts which enables a significant amount of useful text analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside to the non-consumptive dataset approach is that some text analysis methods, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), require full-text data for the most accurate results."

    "* Unigrams- A single-word construction, for example: \"vegetable\".\n",
    "* Bigrams- An two-word construction, for example: \"vegetable stock\".\n",
    "* Trigrams- A three-word construction, for example: \"homemade vegetable stock\".\n",
    "\n",
    "While having the full texts for the documents in your corpus is ideal, a great deal can be still be discovered through the use of unigrams. Even when researchers have access to the full-texts of a corpus, it is common for them to create a list of n-gram counts for analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a non-profit, Constellate gives the maximum access (as allowed by law) to its textual data without charge. We offer additional services for a modest fee in the form of educational classes, community events, and a specialized lab designed for teaching, learning, and research. We do not resell content to libraries that have purchased licenses for those materials. In fact, we offer access to all of our available materials for text analysis—whether or not the institution has licensed them. \n",

    "\n",
    "For a major text analysis project, such as UNC Chapel Hill's [On the Books: Jim Crow and Algorithms of Resistance](https://onthebooks.lib.unc.edu/), about 90% of the labor is creating the corpus. One of the most significant benefits of using Constellate to teach, learn, and do research is that the dataset builder takes out *the vast majority* of effort in doing text analysis. Of course, we recognize researchers' scholarly interests may require building their own dataset, and we support researchers by offering educational classes and events on building a dataset. Of course, we also offer the Constellate Lab for conducting and sharing research.\n",

    "Consider the data's current form as well as the size and skill of your project staff. The corpus creation process could take anywhere from a few hours to many years of labor. If there is a significant amount of labor, you may need to write a grant proposal to hire help. *If writing a grant, contact your library early in the process since funding agencies will require a data preservation plan in the grant application, which will likely include committing your dataset to your institutional repository.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the cleaned-up texts for your corpus, you will also need a strategy for dealing with textual metadata, information such as author, year, etc. Some of this is discussed in [Tokenize Text Files with NLTK](./tokenize-text-files-with-nltk.ipynb), but it would also help to have some experience with working with data at scale. The Python [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) Library is one of the best ways to work with data at scale.

Almost all text analysis tools feature word frequency analysis, often including visualizations such as a [word cloud](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#tag-cloud). When exploring a corpus using word frequencies, it is often helpful to make a distinction between [content words](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#content-words)(generally nouns and verbs) and [function words](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#function-words) (grammatical word constructions like \"the\", \"of\", and \"or\").

This method could be useful if you want to search your corpus for the most significant texts based on a word (or set of words). It can also be useful in reverse.

For example, if we were to study newspapers, we would expect that certain words would cluster together into topics that match the sections of the newspaper. We might see something like:\n",

    "* Topic 1: baseball, ball, player, trade, score, win, defeat\n",

If we have never read a set of documents, we might use a topic analysis to get a sense of what topics are in a given corpus. Given that Topic Analysis is an exploratory technique, it may require some expertise to fine-tune and get good results for a given corpus.

A concordance gives the context of a given word or phrase in a body of texts. For example, a literary scholar might ask: how often and in what context does Shakespeare use the phrase \"honest Iago\" in Othello?
